       "{'Asian_Responses_to_Imperialism_Crash_Course_World_History_213_json': [\"Hi, I'm John Green. This is crash course world history. And today we're going to return to our old friend, the rise of the west. Oh, Mr. Green, we know the west rose, we've talked about this a million times. Yeah, me from the past. I'm sympathetic to your position. But the thing is, this is a big deal in world history circles, and today we are going to talk about the rise of the west from the perspective of people who don't live there. So today we're going to look at how some people who experienced the rise of the west firsthand responded to it. We're going to focus on East Asia and also the Middle East, which is also Asia. Anyway, both of these communities dealt with European imperialism in the 19th and early 20th centuries. So just a quick note here. European imperialism affected millions of people, including agricultural and industrial workers, very few of whom left records of their experience. So we end up relying on the words of people who wrote things down intellectuals. Now, many of those people were European, but in this case, most of what we'll be examining today is covered by a fascinating book by Pankaj Mishra called The Ruins of Empire the Revolt Against the west and the Remaking of Asia. Mishra's book draws heavily from the perspectives of three Asian thinkers. And I will remind you, mispronouncing things is my thing. He looked at Middle Easterner sayed Jamal Aden, Alafgani, Lang Chikao from China and Rabindranath Tagore from India. Through their eyes, we can see that Asians did recognize the coming dominance of Europe. But they also developed ideas about imperialism that provided a counterweight to Western dominance and gave them a way of imagining their role in this new world. All right, let's go straight to the thought bubble. Although we tend to equate European imperialism with the late 19th century, especially the carving up of Africa after the Berlin Conference of 1884, for many Asians, the disaster began. Earlier. In China, the Opium Wars began a train of humiliation, the most memorable of which occurred with the destruction of the Summer Palace in 1860s. And imperialism wasn't great for the Muslim world either. By 1896, Alafgani described Muslims under European imperialism this way the foreigners chain up Muslims, put around their necks a yoke of servitude, debase them, humiliate their lineage, and they do not mention their name, but with insult. Sometimes they call them savages and sometimes regard them as hard hearted and cruel, and finally consider them insane animals. What a disaster. Just like today's historians, asian intellectuals were quick to recognize that the reason Europeans were able to dominate and humiliate them was Europe's superior industrial technology and organization. One early response was to say, well, if you can't beat them, join them.\",\n",
       "  \"We see this in attempts at reform like the Tanzania and the Ottoman Empire. Ala ghani initially echoed these calls to study more science and philosophy. But his comparison of philosophers with profits was too radical for the Ottomans and he ended up being expelled from Istanbul. Chinese intellectuals responded similarly to the humiliation of the Opium Wars with calls for self strengthening, a phrase coined by its biggest supporter, Fenglifeng. Given China's almost 2000 year history of an education system based on confucian values and classical texts, which, to be fair, had worked pretty well for them for most of that time, adopting Western models of education and organization was going to be a tough sell. As Yan Fu, a Chinese writer and translator, put it, china governs the realm through filial piety, while westerns govern the realm with impartiality. China values the sovereign, while Westerners esteem the people. China prizes the one way, while Westerners prefer diversity in learning, chinese praise breadth of wisdom, while Westerners rely on human strength. One Chinese reformer, Kenya Wei, took up the challenge of blending western and Chinese ideas of governance by attempting to update Confucianism for the modern world and arguing that political reform and mass mobilization were central concerns for Confucius himself. Thanks thought bubble. So all of that gets to a big question. Imperialism was a disaster for a lot of people, but there were things about what the west was doing to control much of the world that were obviously working. So the question for people outside the west became what, if anything, do we take from this and try to borrow and integrate into our own communities? Well, in addition to education and military reforms, many Asian intellectuals felt that Europe's strength was rooted in its political organization into nation states. That sounds a lot like today's historians and also economists. Everyone's crazy about nation states except the Mongols. And you know what? I stand with the Mongols on that. I think empire is underrated. I would make an excellent emperor. For instance, you know what they'd call me? Stan genghis. John. Anybody? Yeah, I hate myself. But anyway, some of these intellectuals became proponents of nationalism. Like by 1879, Alf Ghani was advocating that Muslims begin to think of themselves as a nation in the sense of a culturally unified people. Here he is in words that recall the German nationalists of the time there is no happiness except through nationality, and no nationality except through language. A people without unity and a people without literature are a people without language. A people without history are a people without glory, and a people will lack history if authorities do not rise among them to protect and revivify the memory of their historical heroes so that they may follow and emulate.\",\n",
       "  \"Are you sure that wasn't a German nationalist stand? Because that was a lot of fatherlands. Maybe it was translated by a German. And then there's India. As the most thoroughly colonized Asian territory. India's feelings about nationalism were very complicated. Some Indians wanted to create a European style state organized around Hinduism. But of course, India had a large Muslim minority. And also Hinduism, with its caste divisions, wasn't great for creating political unity. Others, like Orbindo Ghosh, were critical of adopting too many European ideas, worrying that India Quote was in danger of losing its soul by an insensate surrender to the aberrations of European materialism. Aberrations of European materialism? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, that is delicious. Hold on, I got to play floppy bird for a second. But many Asians considering adopting European models of nationalism looked to one of its biggest success stories japan. For Europeans, Japan became kind of a confirmation of a modernization program. Industrialization, centralization and to a lesser degree, liberal constitutionalism could work. And this was also true to some extent for Asian intellectuals, including Lang Chikao and Rabindanath Tagore, both of whom visited Japan. But ultimately, Japan didn't provide a great model for other Asians attempting to reform their own states, especially because Japan embarked on its own imperial expansion. It's almost as if, in addition to industrialization and centralization and et cetera, imperialism was just part of building a strong nation state. So by the early 20th century, many Asian intellectuals were looking beyond Western models. Some, like lingxikao and Alafgani considered supranational movements like panasianism and pan arabism. They envisioned these huge political conglomerates that could transcend Europe's dominance. But eventually, both they and Trigor turned to their own traditions as a source of strength. And what they all had in common was a loss of faith in liberal democracy as a source of strength, especially after the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Like after flirting with Pan Arabism and being expelled from a different Ottoman city. This time, Cairo Alfgani became convinced that Quote modernization hadn't secured the Ottomans against infidels. On the contrary, it had made them more dependent. He embraced the idea that the best defense against the west was Islam. Mistress says of this as he saw it, attacking religion risked undermining the moral basis of society altogether and weakened the bonds that held communities together precisely the weakening that had plunged Muslims everywhere into crisis. Now, this doesn't mean that he became what we today think of as an Islamist radical or an antimodeernist. Instead, he believed that the Quran contained its own calls for reform and that Islam could be a catalyst for change.\",\n",
       "  \"Like his favorite Quranic injunction was god does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition. In China, Lang Chikao came up with a different source of reform the strong state. After the failure of the Boxer Rebellion. In 19 one, he wrote his awesomely titled on the New Rules for Destroying Countries. This was a critique of European imperialism, but it was also a call for a strong, somewhat authoritarian state that could stand up to the west. That China would never do that. Oh, wait, wait a second. They did. Eventually, he came to the conclusion that the Chinese people must now accept authoritarian rule. They cannot enjoy freedom. Well, that's pretty extreme. Oh, it's time for the open letter. But first, let's see what's in the globe today. Oh, look, it's some underappreciated authoritarian rulers. An open letter to authoritarianism. Dear Authoritarianism, listen, I am all for democracy, but the tyranny of the majority is no joke. And there have been many times when democratically elected governments were less pluralistic than authoritarian ones. Not only that, if you can keep corruption out of it, there is an astonishing efficiency to doing it your way. Like, who's going to make this decision? Oh, I know. The Queen. It's always the queen. No need for exploratory committees or different houses of Congress. The queen can do it. Maybe I'm just a little frustrated with congressional gridlock authoritarianism, but I kind of think you're underrated. Best wishes, John Green. He just want to confirm that I'm not advocating for authoritarian rule in the United States. So Lange also visited the United States, which made him more convinced that liberal democracies did not provide an answer, especially because they discriminated so much against Asians. And then World War I and the insane map drawing spree of the Treaty of Versailles just further confirmed all of it. I mean, despite the lofty rhetoric of Woodrow Wilson's 14 points in the League of nations, and everything the result of the war looked suspiciously like the prewar imperialism that many Asians believed was a cause of the war in the first place. But perhaps no one was more skeptical of the if you can't fight them, emulate them strategy of dealing with imperialism than Indians. Gandhi, for instance, went very far in his critique of the West's modernism, saying that it lacked spiritual freedom and social harmony, even rejecting many aspects of the Industrial Revolution itself. I mean, this was a person who sewed his own clothes. And interestingly, one of the most vocal Indian critics of the west was the one who was perhaps most positively received there. Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for a body of work that essentially said, you guys are terrible at everything.\",\n",
       "  \"Now, he didn't reject industrialization completely, and he acknowledged that, quote, the age belongs to the west and humanity must be grateful to you for your science, but cautioned an audience in New York that, quote, you have exploited those who are helpless and humiliated those who are unfortunate. So, as we've talked about before, our perspective on events really colors our version of the truth. Living as we do. In an age dominated by more or less liberal nation states with varying degrees of market freedom, it can be tempting to consider their development as both inevitable and good. And I'm certainly not going to throw rocks at both a political system and a nation state that allows and enables me to put up videos like this and provides a space for millions of you to agree and disagree. But when we look at responses to imperialism, I mean, after we get beyond the obvious criticism that imperialism generally is bad, we start to focus on the responses to it that confirm this deep down feeling we have that it was bad to extract all of those resources. But ultimately we spread tolerance and pluralism and the nation state, and those all worked out. So I worry that we look at self strengthening in China or the Ottoman reforms as examples of where Asians were on the right track, and then we see the failure of those reforms as confirmation that Asians were somehow just unready or unfit for the benefits that the west had so generously offered. But if you look at the actual words and actions of Asians who experienced imperialism firsthand, you get a very different picture. Asian thinkers were critical of the west from the very earliest stages of new imperialism. Looking back at the evolution of the intellectuals we've talked about today reminds us that Asians were not simply victims of imperialism's ideology. In fact, they continued to influence ideas about the west today, and not only outside the west. When we in the west lament our insensate surrender to the aberrations of European materialism, we should recognize that that criticism didn't necessarily originate from within. Thanks for watching.

       " 'Decolonization_and_Nationalism_Triumphant_Crash_Course_World_History_40_json': [\"Hi, I'm John Green. This is crash course world history. And today we're going to talk about decolonisation. The empire's European states formed in the 19th century proved about as stable and long lasting as Genghis Khan's, leading to so many of the nation states we know and love today. Yes, I'm looking at you, Burundi did you ever know you're my burriti you're everything dan don't cut to the intro I sing like an angel so unless you're over 60 and let's face it, Internet, you're not, you've only ever known a world of nation states. But as we've seen, from Egypt to Alexander the Great to China to Rome to the Mongols, who, for once, are not the exception here, to the Ottomans and the Americas, empire has long been the dominant way we've organized ourselves politically, or at least the way that other people have organized us. Mr. Green. Mr. Green said to them, star wars would have been like a completely different movie. Most of them would have been like, go, empire. Crush those rebels. Yeah. Also, they'd be like, what is this screen that displays crisp, moving images of events that are not currently occurring? Also, not to get off topic, but you never learn what happens after the rebel victory in Star Wars. And as we've learned from the French Revolution to the Arab Spring, revolution is often the easy part. I mean, you think destroying a Death Star is hard? Try negotiating a trade treaty with gun. Guns. Right. Anyway, so the late 20th century was not the first time that empires disintegrated. Rome comes to mind. Also the Persians. And of course, the American Revolution ended one kind of European imperial experiment. But in all those cases, empire struck back. You see what I did there? I mean, Britain lost its 13 colonies but later controlled half of Africa and all of India. And what makes the recent decolonization so special is that, at least so far, no empires have emerged to replace the ones that fell. And this was largely due to World War II, because on some level, the allies were fighting to stop Nazi imperialism. Hitler wanted to take over central Europe and Africa and probably the Middle East. And the allied defeat of the Nazis discredited the whole idea of empire. So the English, French and Americans couldn't very well say to the colonial troops who'd fought alongside them, thank you so much for helping us to thwart Germany's imperialistic ambitions. As a reward, please hand in your rifle and return to your state of subjugation. Plus, most of the big colonial powers, especially France, Britain and Japan, had been significantly weakened by World War II, by which I mean that large swaths of them looked like this. So postwar decolonization happened all over the place. The British colony that had once been India became three independent nations.\",\n",
       "  \"French Indochina became Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. And the Dutch East Indies became Indonesia. But of course, when we think about decolonization, we mostly think about Africa going from this to this. So we're going to oversimplify here because we have to. But decolonization throughout Afriasa had some similar characteristics. Because it occurred in the context of the Cold War, many of these new nations had to choose between socialist and capitalist influences which shaped their futures. While many of these new countries eventually adopted some form of democracy, the road there was often rocky. Also, decolonization often involved violence, usually the overthrow of colonial elites. For now, let's turn to the most famous nonviolent decolonization, or supposedly so, anyway, that of India. So the story begins more or less in 1885 with the founding of the Indian National Congress. Congress party leaders and other nationalists in India were usually from the elite classes. Initially, they didn't even demand independence from Britain, but they were interested in creating a modern Indian nation rather than a return to some ancient precolonial form. Possibly because India was and is hugely diverse and really only unified into a single state when under imperial rule by one group or another, whether the Morians, the Guptas, the Mughals or the British. Okay, let's go to the thought bubble. The best known Indian nationalist, Mohandas K. Gandhi, was a fascinating character. A British educated lawyer, born to a wealthy family, he's known for making his own clothes, his long fasts, and his battles to alleviate poverty, improve the rights of women and achieve a unified Indian independence from Britain. In terms of decolonization, he stands out for his use of nonviolence and is linking it to a somewhat mythologized view of Indian history. I mean, after all, there's plenty of violence in India's past and in its heroic epics. But Gandhi managed to hearken back to a past that used nonviolence to bring change. Gandhi and his compatriot, Jawahar al Nehru believed that a single India could continue to be ruled by Indian elites and somehow transcend the tension between the country's Hindu majority and its sizable Muslim minority. In this, they were less practical than their contemporary Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, who felt, to quote historian Ainslie Embry, that the unified India of which the Congress spoke was an artificial one created and maintained by British Bayonets. Jinnah proved correct. And in 1947, when the British left, their Indian colony was partitioned into the modern state of India and west and East Pakistan, the latter of which became Bangladesh in 1971. While it's easy to congratulate both the British and the Indian governments on an orderly and nonviolent transfer of power, the reality of partition was neither orderly nor nonviolent.\",\n",
       "  \"As people left their home, sometimes unwillingly, there was violence, and all told, as many as half a million people were killed. More than died in the bloody Indonesian battle for independence. So, while it's true that the massive protests that forced Britain to end its colonization of India were nonviolent, the emergence of the independent states involved really wasn't. Thanks thought bubble. All this violence devastated Gandhi, whose lengthy and repeated hunger strikes to end violence had mixed results, and who was eventually assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who felt that Gandhi was too sympathetic to Muslims. Oh, it's time for the open letter. An open letter to hunger strikers. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. A cupcake stand. This just seems cruel. These are from Meredith, the intern to celebrate Mere Abraration, the holiday she invented to celebrate the anniversary of her singleness. Dear hunger strikers, you remember earlier when I said that Gandhi harkened back to a mythologized Indian past? Well, it turns out that hunger strike in India goes back all the way to the fifth century BCE. Hunger strikes have been used around the world, including British and American suffragettes who hunger struck to get the vote. And in pre Christian Ireland, when you felt wronged by someone, it was common practice to sit on their doorstep and hunger strike until your grievance was addressed. And sometimes it even works. I really admire you, hunger strikers, but I lack the courage of your convictions. Also, this is an amazing cupcake. Since independence, India has largely been a success story, although we will talk about the complexity of India's emerging global capitalism next week. For now, though, let's travel east to Indonesia, a huge nation of over 13,000 islands that has largely been ignored here on crash Course World history due to our long standing bias against islands like we haven't even mentioned Greenland on this show. The Greenlanders, of course, haven't complained because they don't have the internet. So the Dutch exploited their island colonies with the system of culturstyle in which all peasants had to set aside one fifth of their land to grow cash crops for export to the Netherlands. This accounted for 25% of the total Dutch national budget. And it explains why they have all kinds of fancy buildings. Despite technically living underwater. They're like sea monkeys. This system was rather less popular in Indonesia, and the Dutch didn't offer much in exchange. They couldn't even defend their colony from the Japanese, who occupied it for most of World War II. During which time the Japanese furthered the cause of Indonesian nationalism by placing native Indonesians in more prominent positions of power, including Sukarno, who became Indonesia's first prime minister.\",\n",
       "  \"Over in the French colonies of Indochina, so called because they were neither Indian nor Chinese, things were even more violent. The end of colonization was disastrous in Cambodia, where the 17 year reign of Noradam Sianu gave way to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, which massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia's population between 1975 and 1979. In Vietnam, the French fought communist led nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh, from almost the moment World War II ended until 1954, when the French were defeated. And then the Americans heard that there was a land war available in Asia, so they quickly took over from the French. And Communists did not fully control Vietnam until 1975. Despite still being ostensibly Communist, vietnam now manufactures all kinds of stuff that we like in America, especially sneakers. More about that next week, too. But now to Egypt. You'll remember that Egypt bankrupted itself in the 19th century, trying to industrialize, and ever since had been ruled by an Egyptian king who took his orders from the British. So while technically Egypt had been independent since 1922, it was very dependent independence. But that changed in the 1950s, when the king was overthrown by the army. The army commander who led that coup was Gamal Abdul Nasr, who proved brilliant at playing the US and the USSR off each other to the benefit of Egypt. Nasser's was a largely secular nationalism, and he and his successors saw one of the other antiimperialistic nationalist forces in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, as a threat. So once in power, Nasr and the army banned the Muslim Brotherhood, forcing it underground, where it would disappear and never become an issue again. Wait, what's that? Really? And finally, let's turn to central and southern Africa. One of the most problematic legacies of colonialism was its geography. Colonial boundaries became redefined as the borders of new nation states, even where those boundaries were arbitrary or in some cases, pernicious. The best known example is in Rwanda, where two very different tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsis, were combined into one nation. But more generally, the colonizers focus on value extraction really hurt these new nations. Europeans claimed to bring civilization and economic development to their colonies, but this economic development focused solely on building infrastructure to get resources and export them. Now, whether European powers deliberately sabotage development in Africa is a hot button topic we're going to stay well away from. But this much is inarguably true. When the Europeans left, african nations did not have the institutions necessary to thrive in the postwar industrial world. They had very few schools, for instance, and even fewer universities, like when the Congo achieved independence from Belgium in 1960, there were 16 Congolese college graduates in a nation of 14 million people.\",\n",
       "  \"Most Europeans didn't rule their African possessions directly, but rather through the proxies of local rulers. And once Europeans left those local rulers, the upper classes were seen as illegitimate collaborators. And this meant that a new group of rulers had to rise up to take their place, often with very little experience in governance. I mean, zimbabwe's long serving dictator. Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher. Let that be a lesson to you. Your teachers may have dictatorial ambitions, but most strong men have emerged, of course, from the military. Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo, which he held from 1965 until his death in 1997. Idi Amin was military dictator of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Moamar Gaddafi ruled Libya from 1977 until 2011. The list goes on. But I don't want to give you the wrong impression about Africa. Because while the continent does have less freedom and lower levels of development than other regions in the world, many African nations show strong and consistent signs of growth, despite the challenges of decolonization. Botswana, for instance, has gone from 70% literacy to 85% in the past 15 years and has seen steady GDP growth over 5%. Benin's economy has grown in each of the past twelve years, which is better than Europe or the US. Can say. In 2002, Kenya's life expectancy was 47. Today, it's 63. Ethiopia's per capita GDP has doubled over the past ten years, and Mauritania has seen its infant mortality rate fall by more than 40%. Now, this progress is spotty and fragile, but it's important to note that these nations have existed, on average, about 13 years less than my dad. Of course, past experience with the fall of empires hasn't given us much cause for hope, but many citizens of these new nations are seeing real progress. That said, disaster might lurk around the corner. It's hard to say. I mean, now more than ever, we're trying to tell the story of humans from inside the story of humans. Thanks for watching.

       " 'Indus_Valley_Civilization_Crash_Course_World_History_2_json': [\"Hi. I'm John Green and this is Crash Course World History. Let's begin today with a question why am I alive? Also, why don't I have any eyes? Oh, that's better. The way we answer that question ends up organizing all kinds of other thoughts, like what we should value and how we should behave, and if we should eat meat, and whether we should dump that boy who is very nice but insanely clingy in a way that he cannot possibly think is attractive. All of which, Mr. Green, Mr. Green? Are you you talking about me? Yes, I am talking about you. Me from the past. I am telling you that one of the reasons we study history is so that you can be a less terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily. Today we're going to talk about civilizations. But in order to do that, we have to talk about talking about civilizations, because it's a problematic word. So problematic, in fact, that I have to turn to camera two to discuss it. Certain conglomerations of humans are seen as civilizations, whereas, say, nomadic cultures generally aren't, unless you are, say it with me, the Mongols. By calling some group civilizations, you imply that all other social orders are uncivilized, which is basically just another way of saying that they're savages or barbarians. Side note, originally Greek, the word barbarian denoted anyone who did not speak ancient Greek, because to the Greeks, all other languages sounded like Barbara Bar. So that is to say that we are all essentially barbarians except for the classics majors, which is worth remembering when we're discussing civilizations. Civilizations are like most of the things we like to study. They're intellectual constructs. No one woke up in the city of Thebes in Egypt one morning and said, what a beautiful morning. I sure am living at the height of Egyptian civilization. Still, they're useful constructs, particularly when you're comparing one civilization to another. They're less useful when you're comparing a civilization to a non civilization type social order, which is why we will try to avoid that. And yes, I am getting to the good boyfriend stuff. Patience, grasshopper. So what is a civilization?\",\n",
       "  \"If you have four or more of the following symptoms, you might be a civilization surplus production. Once one person can make enough food to feed several people, it becomes possible to build a city, another symptom of civilization. It also leads to the specialization of labor, which in turn leads to trade. Like if everybody picks berries for a living, there is no reason to trade because I have berries and you have berries. But if I pick berries for a living and you make hammers, suddenly we have cause to trade. Civilizations are also usually associated with social stratification, centralized government, shared values, generally in the form of religion and writing. And at least in the early days, they were almost always associated with rivers, these days you can just bisect a segment of land horizontally and vertically and boom, build a city. But 5000 years ago, civilizations were almost always associated with rivers, whether that's the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Yellow River, the Nile, the Amazon Basin, the Kawatza Kualcos. God, I was doing so good until I got to Kawaza Kualcoasta. Koalakus. Kawaza koalcos, maybe. Why river valleys? They're flat, they're well wandered, and when they flood, they deposit nutrient rich silt. We'll have more to say about most of these civilizations later, but let's talk about this guy, the Indus Valley civilization, because it's my all time favorite. The Indus Valley civilization was located in the floodplain of the Indus and Sawardi rivers, and it was about the best place in the world to have an ancient civilization because the rivers flooded very reliably twice a year, which meant that it had the most available calories per acre of pretty much anywhere on the planet. We know the Indus Valley civilization flourished a long time ago, probably around 3000 BCE. Why? Is that question literally hanging over my head? But people of the Indus Valley were trading with Mesopotamians as early as 3500 BCE. We also know that it was the largest of the ancient civilizations. Archaeologists have discovered more than 1500 sites. So what do we know about this civilization? Let's go to the thought bubble. Everything we know about the Indus Valley civilization comes from archaeology, because while they did use written language, we don't know how to read it. And no Rosetta Stone has thus far appeared to help us learn it.\",\n",
       "  \"Yeah, although, come to think of it, either would be acceptable. So here's what we know. They had amazing cities. Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best known, with dense multi story homes constructed out of uniformly sized bricks along perpendicular streets. I mean, this wasn't some ancient world version of Houston, more like Chicago. This means they must have had some form of government and zoning, but we don't know what gave this government its authority. Cities were oriented to catch the wind and provide a natural form of air conditioning. And they were clean. Most homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste and water out of the city in big sewer ditches that ran under the main avenues. A plumbing system that would have been the envy of many 18th century European cities. Also in Mahanja Dara, the largest public building was not a temple or a palace, but a public bath, which historians call the Great Bath. We don't know what the Great Bath was used for, but since later Indian culture placed a huge emphasis on ritual purity, which is the basis for the caste system, some historians have speculated that the bath might have been like a giant baptismal pool. Also, they traded one of the coolest things that the Indus Valley civilization produced were seals used as identification markers on goods and clay tablets. These seals contain the writing that we still can't decipher and a number of fantastic designs, many featuring animals and monsters. One of the most famous and frightening is of a man with what looks like water buffalo horns on his head, sitting cross legged between a tiger and a bull. We don't know what's really going on here, but it's safe to say that this was a powerful dude, because he seems to be able to control the tiger. How did these seals let us know that they traded? Well, because we found them in Mesopotamia, not the Indus Valley. Plus, archaeologists have found stuff like bronze in the Indus Valley that is not native to the region. So what did they trade? Cotton cloth. Still such a fascinating export incidentally that it will be the subject of the final video in this very series. But here's the most amazing thing about the Indus Valley people they were peaceful.\",\n",
       "  \"Thanks, thought bubble. OK, before we talk about the fascinating demise of the Indus Valley civilization, it's time for the open letter magic. I wonder what the secret compartment has for me today. Oh, fancy clothes. I guess the secret compartment didn't think I was dressed up enough for the occasion. An open letter to historians. Dear Historians, the Great Bath. Really? The great bath. I'm trying to make history fascinating, and you give me a term that evokes scented candles, bath salts, and Frederick Fakai hair products. I know sometimes the crushingly boring names of history aren't your fault. You didn't name the Federalist Papers, or the Austro Hungarian Empire, or Adam Smith. But when you do get a chance to name something, you go with the Great Bath. Not the epic bath of Mohenjo Daro or the bath to end all baths, or the pool that ruled or the moist mystery of Mohenjo Daro or the wet wonder, the Great Bath. Really? You can do better. Best wishes, John Green. So what happened to these people? Well, here's what didn't happen to them. They didn't morph into the current residents of that area of the world. Hindu Indians or Muslim Pakistanis. Those people probably came from the Caucasus. Instead, sometime around 1750 BCE, the Indus Valley civilization declined until it faded into obscurity. Why? Historians have three theories. One, conquest. Turns out to be a terrible military strategy not to have any weapons. And it's possible people from the Indus Valley were completely overrun by people from the Caucasus. Two, environmental disaster. It's possible they brought about their own end by destroying their environment. Three earthquake. The most interesting theory is that a massive earthquake changed the course of the rivers so much that a lot of the tributaries dried up. Without adequate water supplies for irrigation, the cities couldn't sustain themselves. So people literally just picked up and left for greener pastures. Well, probably not pastures. It's unlikely they became nomads.\",\n",
       "  \"I am already boring you, and I haven't even told you yet how to be a better boy and or girlfriend. I'm going to do that now. So we don't know why the Indus Valley civilization ended, but we also don't really know why it started. Why did these people build cities and dig swimming pools and make unnecessarily ornate seals? Were they motivated by hunger, fear, a desire for companionship, the need to be near their sacred spaces, or a general feeling that city life was just more awesome than foraging? Thinking about what motivated them to structure their life as they did helped us to think about how we structure our own lives. In short, you're clingy because you're motivated by fear and a need for companionship. And she finds it annoying because it's enough work having to be responsible for herself without having to also be responsible for you. Also, you're not really helping her by clinging. And from the Indus Valley in the Bronze Age to school life, today human life is all about collaboration trading cloth for bronze, building cities together, and collaborating to make sure that human lives are tilted to catch the wind.

       " 'The_Agricultural_Revolution_Crash_Course_World_History_1_json': [\"Hello, learned and astonishingly attractive pupils. My name is John Green, and I want to welcome you to Crash Course World History. Over the next 40 weeks, together, we will learn how, in a mere 15,000 years, humans went from hunting and gathering. Mr. Green, is is this going to be on the test? Yeah. About the test. The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged and productive citizen of the world. And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms, rooms. And in places of worship. You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football, and while scrolling through your Twitter feed. The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages, whether you'll be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric, and whether you'll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context. The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that, when taken together, make your life, yours, and everything, everything will be on it. I know, right? So pay attention. In a mere 15,000 years, humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the Internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger. It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own. Over to camera two. Hi there, camera two. It's me, John Green. Let's start with that double cheeseburger. Oh, food photography. So this hot honey meat contains 490 calories. To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed, raise, and slaughter cows, then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination. You also got to grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elizabeth I. Then you got to milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese. And that's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening of tomatoes or the grinding of mustard seeds, et cetera. How in the sweet name of everything holy did we ever come to live in a world in which such a thing can even be created? And how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US. I can earn in eleven minutes? And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of relative abundance?\",\n",
       "  \"But thanks to archeology and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past. Let's go to the thought bubble. So, 15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters. Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses. Hunting allowed for a more protein rich diet, so long as you could find something with meat to kill. By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world, incidentally, was fishing, which is one of the reasons that if you look at the history of people populating the planet, we tended to run for the shore and then stay there. Marine life was a abundant and B relatively unlikely to eat you. While we tend to think that the lives of foragers were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence suggests that they actually had it pretty good. Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists and anthropologists who've studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us and they spend more time on art, music and storytelling. Also, if you believe the classic of anthropology, Nisa, they also have a lot more time for scooterly pooping. What? I call it scooterly pooping. I'm not going to apologize. It's worth noting that cultivation of crops seems to have arisen independently over the course of millennia in a number of places from Africa to China to the Americas, using crops that naturally grew nearby rice in Southeast Asia, maize and Mexico, potatoes in the Andes, wheat and the Fertile Crescent, yams in West Africa. People around the world began to abandon their foraging for agriculture. And since so many communities made this choice independently, it must have been a good choice, right? Even though it meant less music and scooterly pooping. Thanks, thought bubble. All right, to answer that question, let's take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture. Advantage controllable food supply. You might have droughts or floods, but if you're growing the crops and breeding them to be harder, you have a better chance of not starving. Disadvantage in order to keep feeding people as the population grows you have to radically change the environment of the planet. Advantage especially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities possible and also the specialization of labor. Like in the days before agriculture, everybody's job was foraging and it took about 1000 calories of work to create 1000 calories of food and it was impossible to create large population centers. But if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food.\",\n",
       "  \"It's absolutely terrible and it's very cold and I wish that I had not eaten it. I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. This is not that. Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily beneficial to the planet or even to its human inhabitants. Although that's a bit of a tough argument to make, coming to you as I am in a series of ones and zeros advantage. Agriculture can be practiced all over the world. Although in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment, like irrigation, controlled flooding, terroristing, that kind of thing. Disadvantage farming is hard. So hard, in fact, that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans and then have them till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of nonideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities. So why did agriculture happen? Wait, I haven't talked about herders. Herders man always getting the short end of the stick. Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture. You domesticate some animals, and then you take them on the road with you. The advantages of herding are obvious. First, you get to be a cowboy. Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter because they can provide wool and leather. The downside is that you have to move around a lot, because your herd always needs new grass, which makes it hard to build cities, unless you are the Mongols. By the way, over the next 40 weeks, you will frequently hear generalizations, followed by unless you are the Mongols. But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on in certain parts of the world is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication. Like you have sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks all of which have something in common. They aren't native to the Americas. The only halfway useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama. No, not that llama. Two elves. Yes, that llama. Most animals just don't work for domestication. Like hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat, but unfortunately, they like to eat people. Zebras are too. Ornery grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken. Elephants are awesome, but they take way too long to breed. Which reminds me, it's time for the open letter.\",\n",
       "  \"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger. Thanks. Secret compartment? Just kidding. I don't thank you for this. An open letter to elephants. Hey, elephants. You're so cute and smart and awesome. Why you got to be pregnant for 22 months? That's crazy. And then you only have one kid. If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now. Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage being useful to humans, like here is a graph of cow population. And here is a graph of elephant population. Elephants, if you just inserted yourself into human life the way cows did, you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies, conspiring against the humans. And then you could have risen up and destroyed us and made an awesome elephant world with elephant cars and elephant planes, it would have been so great. But no, you got to be pregnant for 22 months and then have just one kid. It's so annoying. Best wishes, John Green right, but back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred. Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records, but they love to make guesses. Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture, even though it was more work or abundance, gave people leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility, right? Or, as some historians have argued, people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol. Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying a wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise old savage. Off topic, but you will note in the coming weeks that the definition of savage tends to be not me. Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more. Like, early huntergatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted, and when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it. Unless it's just food, then you want to do less of it. A caramel spit out, oh, that's much better. So early farmers would find the most accessible forms of wheat and plant them and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like, you know, it would be awesome.\",\n",
       "  \"In the francave, there's a huge pile of snail shells. Most of them are larger than current snails, suggesting that the people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious. Snails make excellent domesticated food sources, by the way, because A, surprisingly caloric, b they're easy to carry, since they come with their own suitcases, and C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters. That's not really a revolution. That's just people trying to increase available calories. But one non revolution leads to another, and pretty soon you have this as far as the eye can see. Many historians also argue that without agriculture, we wouldn't have all the bad things that come with complex civilizations like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine. And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser. Without it, humans never would have changed the environment so much, building dams and clearing forests and more recently, drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer. Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean it was the right choice? Maybe so and maybe not. But regardless, we can't unmake that choice. And that's one of the reasons I think it's so important to study history. History reminds us that revolutions are not events so much as their processes. That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today. Just as today, we're making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people of the future will remember as revolutions. Next week, we're going to journey to the Indus River Valley. Whoa. It's very fragile. Our globe, like the real globe. We're going to travel to the Indus River Valley. I'll see you then. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Mueller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

       " 'The_Mughal_Empire_and_Historical_Reputation_Crash_Course_World_History_217_json': [\"Hi. I'm John Green. This is crash course world history. And today we're going to talk about the Mughal empire and we're also going to talk about the two most important Mughal emperors akbar and Orangzeb and how their historical reputations were made. Mr. Green. Mr. Green. Don't you mean the Mongol empire? Oh me from the past. That reminds me of the time that you conflated the word fort with the word forte which of course you pronounced fort. But on this occasion you are weren't entirely wrong. The Mughals were kind of the Mongols but we'll get to that in a minute. So the Mughals were Muslims who created an empire in India that held power for roughly 200 years between the early 16th and early 18th centuries. Although technically the Mughal empire didn't come to an end until after the Indian rebellion against the British in 57. Now the Moguls weren't the first Muslims in India. Those would have been merchants and they weren't even the first Muslims to rule significant parts of India. That honor goes to the Delhi Sultanate which began in twelve six in northern India. But the Delhi sultanate didn't last very long. It was replaced by a bunch of regional kingdoms and one of them, the Lodai Sultanate had the misfortune of falling to the founder of the Mughal dynasty Babler in 1526. Not Babar, although that would have been awesome. Babler was descended from Timur, the last great central Asian conqueror in the Mongol tradition and also from Chinggis Khan. Which explains why Babar and his followers are called the Mongols. It's the Persian Arabic word for Mongols. Now I know what you're saying. Something like 12% of human beings currently living in the world are descended from Chinggis Khan's. But Baber got it on the ground floor of it. Anyway, I think we have some footage of Baba rating the Lodi Sultanate, don't we stand? I don't feel like that was actual file footage from twelve six. I feel like that was a racist Hercules movie from Italy in the 1950s. So the Mughal empire is really important in India's cultural history. I mean the Taj Mahal was built during this time. In architecture and painting we see a blending of Indian and Persian styles that demonstrate how cosmopolitan the empire was. But probably the most important aspect of the Moguls, at least as far as the contemporary world is concerned is that they consolidated Muslim rule over much of India and they're largely the reason that today there are so many Indians who are also Muslims.\",\n",
       "  \"All right, let's go to the thought bubble. Muslims were a small minority ruling class vastly outnumbered by Hindus. And like many empires they relied on military power and pursued expansionist policies. Like most of the Mughal rulers, especially Akbar and Orangzev spent a considerable amount of time trying to extend Mughal control over the entire indian subcontinent and they created a pretty effective empire. They were able to incorporate Indian princes into the ruling class while still retaining top positions for Muslims. They reorganized the bureaucracy and instituted an effective tax collection system which was important because the empire was, of course very expensive to run, as empires always are. This meant it was important to make accurate tax assessments and taxes were usually collected by local leaders called zamadars. Taxes had to be paid in cash and this contributed to the growing commercialization of the Mughal empire. Reliance on zamadars who were important men in their communities meant that the empire could collect revenue without being too disruptive to local village life. And although almost all of the revenue came from taxes on agriculture, the Mughals also taxed trade. Another way that the Mughals were a typical empire is that their rulers engaged in building projects to enhance their prestige. From Persepolis to Rome to the Forbidden City, building monuments to one's greatness is what emperors do. And the Mughals were no exception. As Muslims, many of their building projects were mosques but the Mughals also built forts and most spectacularly mausoleums. Thanks thought bubble so most history classes that mentioned the Mughals focus on the contrast between Akbar and Orangzeb akbar comes off as a good ruler and orgzeb is painted as the guy who ruined the empire. Typically positive historians view of Akbar, who ruled from 1556 until 16. Five can be summed up in this quote from Asher and Talbot's India before Europe through his reforms of administration and taxation, Akbar created a sound and enduring foundation for Mukul governance, while his tolerant attitude and inclusive policies toward Hindus and Jains helped create a state that was more Indian in character. That tolerance aspect is especially important. Like Akbar rescinded the jizya, the tax that nonmuslims had to pay. And in 1080, he gave all nonmuslims the same rights as Muslims, instituting a policy called Sula kul, which translates to universal toleration. Now, in part, this policy was designed to lessen the power of Muslim religious scholars who might have been disturbed by the way that Akbar blended Islamic and Indian ideas of kingship.\",\n",
       "  \"Slightly problematic idea to a lot of Muslim scholars given that the foundation of the Islamic faith is the statement there is no God but God, but yeah, you know. In addition to the Suli kule, akbar built his reputation for toleration by sponsoring discussions of religion and philosophy. He even commissioned a building for religious discussions, the Ibadat Khana, where Muslims and Brahmins and Zoroastrians Janes Christians, all of them could talk theology. Akbar's support for intellectual pursuits are the kinds of things that modern historians like. And it's not all that surprising that he's remembered so favorably. Historians are far less kind to Akbar's grandson Aurangzeb, who ruled from 1658 until 17 seven. This is partly due to the work of Jay and zakar, who promoted the idea that Aurangzeb built an Islamic state that discriminated against Hindus and other nonmuslims, which in turn led to a loss of unity across the Indian subcontinent and eventually the decline of the empire. And it's true that by the time of Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughals were losing control over their empire. I mean, the stark reality of that decline came in 1757, when the British East India Company established itself permanently in Bengal and began its inexorable efforts to colonize all of India. But that was 50 years after Orangzeb died. So maybe he shouldn't get all of the blame. In fact, whether these guys deserve their reputations really depends both on what aspects of their reign you look at and how you interpret them. As conquerors, akbar and Orangzeb had a lot in common. Like Akbar might have sponsored high minded discussion, but he was also willing to use extreme violence to keep his subjects in line. For example, he slaughtered thousands of inhabitants of the Fort Echitor and ordered his generals to pile up the skulls of Indian princes to frighten them into submission. That's not especially tolerant. And here's another detail about Akbar's rule that's meant to paint him as a modern, enlightened ruler. Because he was interested in science, Akbar arranged an experiment. He had infants moved to a special house where no person was to talk to them, so that the natural language of mankind might be revealed. The experiment failed, but it is a reflection of Akbar's desire to explore in a scientific manner the nature of humans and what he believed to be their common condition. Now, you can read that as a leader trying to understand the underlying connections among all humans, no matter their religious backgrounds. Or you can read it as horrifying child abuse.\",\n",
       "  \"But the trend toward orthodoxy and away from Akbar's toleration had begun long before with his predecessor, Shah Jahan. He's best known for building the Taj Mahal. Good work, Stan. He built it by himself. Apparently he had some help, but the maintenance of the Taj Mahal took all the revenue from 30 villages. And maybe Aurangzeb's orthodoxy was less important than his desire to appear to be a sober and frugal leader. Orangzeb was also accused of destroying temples in 1669, although, in fact, they were just damaged. And this was primarily done to send a political message to opponents, not as an act of religious orthodox. He also tried to limit expenses at court by prohibiting the use of gold in men's garments. And he stopped the traditional practice of being weighed against gold on his birthday. Unlike Akbar, who was seen as being a patron of the arts, Orangzeb is remembered for getting rid of court musicians and poets. But he got rid of them because of financial constraints. Well, and also because of his interpretation of Islamic law. And that last point interests me. For those who want to see him negatively orangzeb's orthodox, islam had no room for musicians or poets. But it's also possible to see that decision as a prudent, cost saving measure. Here's another detail from Orangzeb's life that's been used to paint him as a zealot. Orangzeb, unlike his predecessors, was buried in a simple outdoor grave rather than an elaborate and expensive tomb. You could see that as a symbol of religious faith or as a sign of humility or an attempt by a thoughtful ruler to spare his subject the expenses of like keeping up his tomb. That said, in the long run, the Taj Mahal has done pretty well in terms of generating tourist money, whereas I don't think anyone's paying to see Orangzeb's grave. But the thing is, Orangzeb needed to save money. If he was a bad ruler, it's mostly because he spent so much time and treasure fighting rebellions in the south of his empire and then neglected the north, where unrest grew as well. It's overly simplistic to say that the glory days of the Mughal empire were about tolerance and the downfall was about intolerance. Really, there were lots of factors that played into the decline of the Mughal empire, including growing factionalism at the Mughal court, the rise of regional powers, and the breakdown of the system of governance by local nobles. Historians are in the business of making claims about what happened and supporting those claims with evidence. And often this evidence provides the details that make reading and learning about history so much fun.\",\n",
       "  \"And the reigns of Akbar and Orangzeb provide good examples of why we need to be careful with our details. It's possible that Aurangzeb was a terrible ruler because he tried to impose Muslim orthodoxy on a Hindu majority, and no doubt many Hindus felt so, especially after he reinstituted the jizya. And he did try to introduce Sharia law as the governing principle in the empire. But it's also possible that Orangzeb's bad reputation comes from a contemporary preference for tolerance over piety in our rulers, or from a general feeling that states are better ruled by secular than religious laws, or from the fact that it's just hard to rule a declining empire. Well, ask President Obama. Our experiences and biases make us more likely to see the dismissal of court musicians and poets as an example of religious fanaticism than as like, a cost saving measure. And maybe Akbar, who could be as brutal in his military conquests as any emperor, comes out in a good light because he did advocate religious toleration. But it wasn't totally or even primarily due to his religious tolerance that Akbar was able to win most of his wars and the many rebellions against his reign suggest that he wasn't as popular with his subjects as he is today with historians. One last note about how the way that we look at the past can shape the present and vice versa. We need to be particularly careful here because the Mughals continue to play an important role in how Indians imagine themselves today. One of the roots of contemporary Hindu nationalism is pride at India's, throwing off the shackles of imperialism. And for many Hindu nationalists, that history of imperialism starts not with the British, but with the Mughals. We often use history to define ourselves today and one of the most common ways to do that is to make negative claims about the people that we say we are not. And so when we look at historical figures, we need to be conscious of the fact that we are looking at them. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

And today we're going to talk about the Mughal empire and we're also going to talk about the two most important Mughal emperors akbar and Orangzeb and how their historical reputations were made. Mr. Green. Mr. Green. Don't you mean the Mongol empire? Oh me from the past. That reminds me of the time that you conflated the word fort with the word forte which of course you pronounced fort. But on this occasion you are weren't entirely wrong. The Mughals were kind of the Mongols but we'll get to that in a minute. So the Mughals were Muslims who created an empire in India that held power for roughly 200 years between the early 16th and early 18th centuries. Although technically the Mughal empire didn't come to an end until after the Indian rebellion against the British in 57. Now the Moguls weren't the first Muslims in India. Those would have been merchants and they weren't even the first Muslims to rule significant parts of India. That honor goes to the Delhi Sultanate which began in twelve six in northern India. But the Delhi sultanate didn't last very long. It was replaced by a bunch of regional kingdoms and one of them, the Lodai Sultanate had the misfortune of falling to the founder of the Mughal dynasty Babler in 1526. Not Babar, although that would have been awesome. Babler was descended from Timur, the last great central Asian conqueror in the Mongol tradition and also from Chinggis Khan. Which explains why Babar and his followers are called the Mongols. It's the Persian Arabic word for Mongols. Now I know what you're saying. Something like 12% of human beings currently living in the world are descended from Chinggis Khan's. But Baber got it on the ground floor of it. Anyway, I think we have some footage of Baba rating the Lodi Sultanate, don't we stand? I don't feel like that was actual file footage from twelve six. I feel like that was a racist Hercules movie from Italy in the 1950s. So the Mughal empire is really important in India's cultural history. I mean the Taj Mahal was built during this time. In architecture and painting we see a blending of Indian and Persian styles that demonstrate how cosmopolitan the empire was. But probably the most important aspect of the Moguls, at least as far as the contemporary world is concerned is that they consolidated Muslim rule over much of India and they're largely the reason that today there are so many Indians who are also Muslims.\"],\n",

       "  \"But the trend toward orthodoxy and away from Akbar's toleration had begun long before with his predecessor, Shah Jahan. He's best known for building the Taj Mahal. Good work, Stan. He built it by himself. Apparently he had some help, but the maintenance of the Taj Mahal took all the revenue from 30 villages. And maybe Aurangzeb's orthodoxy was less important than his desire to appear to be a sober and frugal leader. Orangzeb was also accused of destroying temples in 1669, although, in fact, they were just damaged. And this was primarily done to send a political message to opponents, not as an act of religious orthodox. He also tried to limit expenses at court by prohibiting the use of gold in men's garments. And he stopped the traditional practice of being weighed against gold on his birthday. Unlike Akbar, who was seen as being a patron of the arts, Orangzeb is remembered for getting rid of court musicians and poets. But he got rid of them because of financial constraints. Well, and also because of his interpretation of Islamic law. And that last point interests me. For those who want to see him negatively orangzeb's orthodox, islam had no room for musicians or poets. But it's also possible to see that decision as a prudent, cost saving measure. Here's another detail from Orangzeb's life that's been used to paint him as a zealot. Orangzeb, unlike his predecessors, was buried in a simple outdoor grave rather than an elaborate and expensive tomb. You could see that as a symbol of religious faith or as a sign of humility or an attempt by a thoughtful ruler to spare his subject the expenses of like keeping up his tomb. That said, in the long run, the Taj Mahal has done pretty well in terms of generating tourist money, whereas I don't think anyone's paying to see Orangzeb's grave. But the thing is, Orangzeb needed to save money. If he was a bad ruler, it's mostly because he spent so much time and treasure fighting rebellions in the south of his empire and then neglected the north, where unrest grew as well. It's overly simplistic to say that the glory days of the Mughal empire were about tolerance and the downfall was about intolerance. Really, there were lots of factors that played into the decline of the Mughal empire, including growing factionalism at the Mughal court, the rise of regional powers, and the breakdown of the system of governance by local nobles. Historians are in the business of making claims about what happened and supporting those claims with evidence. And often this evidence provides the details that make reading and learning about history so much fun.\"],\n",

       "  \"We see this in attempts at reform like the Tanzania and the Ottoman Empire. Ala ghani initially echoed these calls to study more science and philosophy. But his comparison of philosophers with profits was too radical for the Ottomans and he ended up being expelled from Istanbul. Chinese intellectuals responded similarly to the humiliation of the Opium Wars with calls for self strengthening, a phrase coined by its biggest supporter, Fenglifeng. Given China's almost 2000 year history of an education system based on confucian values and classical texts, which, to be fair, had worked pretty well for them for most of that time, adopting Western models of education and organization was going to be a tough sell. As Yan Fu, a Chinese writer and translator, put it, china governs the realm through filial piety, while westerns govern the realm with impartiality. China values the sovereign, while Westerners esteem the people. China prizes the one way, while Westerners prefer diversity in learning, chinese praise breadth of wisdom, while Westerners rely on human strength. One Chinese reformer, Kenya Wei, took up the challenge of blending western and Chinese ideas of governance by attempting to update Confucianism for the modern world and arguing that political reform and mass mobilization were central concerns for Confucius himself. Thanks thought bubble. So all of that gets to a big question. Imperialism was a disaster for a lot of people, but there were things about what the west was doing to control much of the world that were obviously working. So the question for people outside the west became what, if anything, do we take from this and try to borrow and integrate into our own communities? Well, in addition to education and military reforms, many Asian intellectuals felt that Europe's strength was rooted in its political organization into nation states. That sounds a lot like today's historians and also economists. Everyone's crazy about nation states except the Mongols. And you know what? I stand with the Mongols on that. I think empire is underrated. I would make an excellent emperor. For instance, you know what they'd call me? Stan genghis. John. Anybody? Yeah, I hate myself. But anyway, some of these intellectuals became proponents of nationalism. Like by 1879, Alf Ghani was advocating that Muslims begin to think of themselves as a nation in the sense of a culturally unified people. Here he is in words that recall the German nationalists of the time there is no happiness except through nationality, and no nationality except through language. A people without unity and a people without literature are a people without language. A people without history are a people without glory, and a people will lack history if authorities do not rise among them to protect and revivify the memory of their historical heroes so that they may follow and emulate.\"],\n",

       "  \"Like his favorite Quranic injunction was god does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition. In China, Lang Chikao came up with a different source of reform the strong state. After the failure of the Boxer Rebellion. In 19 one, he wrote his awesomely titled on the New Rules for Destroying Countries. This was a critique of European imperialism, but it was also a call for a strong, somewhat authoritarian state that could stand up to the west. That China would never do that. Oh, wait, wait a second. They did. Eventually, he came to the conclusion that the Chinese people must now accept authoritarian rule. They cannot enjoy freedom. Well, that's pretty extreme. Oh, it's time for the open letter. But first, let's see what's in the globe today. Oh, look, it's some underappreciated authoritarian rulers. An open letter to authoritarianism. Dear Authoritarianism, listen, I am all for democracy, but the tyranny of the majority is no joke. And there have been many times when democratically elected governments were less pluralistic than authoritarian ones. Not only that, if you can keep corruption out of it, there is an astonishing efficiency to doing it your way. Like, who's going to make this decision? Oh, I know. The Queen. It's always the queen. No need for exploratory committees or different houses of Congress. The queen can do it. Maybe I'm just a little frustrated with congressional gridlock authoritarianism, but I kind of think you're underrated. Best wishes, John Green. He just want to confirm that I'm not advocating for authoritarian rule in the United States. So Lange also visited the United States, which made him more convinced that liberal democracies did not provide an answer, especially because they discriminated so much against Asians. And then World War I and the insane map drawing spree of the Treaty of Versailles just further confirmed all of it. I mean, despite the lofty rhetoric of Woodrow Wilson's 14 points in the League of nations, and everything the result of the war looked suspiciously like the prewar imperialism that many Asians believed was a cause of the war in the first place. But perhaps no one was more skeptical of the if you can't fight them, emulate them strategy of dealing with imperialism than Indians. Gandhi, for instance, went very far in his critique of the West's modernism, saying that it lacked spiritual freedom and social harmony, even rejecting many aspects of the Industrial Revolution itself. I mean, this was a person who sewed his own clothes. And interestingly, one of the most vocal Indian critics of the west was the one who was perhaps most positively received there. Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for a body of work that essentially said, you guys are terrible at everything.\"],\n",

I am telling you that one of the reasons we study history is so that you can be a less terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily. Today we're going to talk about civilizations. But in order to do that, we have to talk about talking about civilizations, because it's a problematic word. So problematic, in fact, that I have to turn to camera two to discuss it. Certain conglomerations of humans are seen as civilizations, whereas, say, nomadic cultures generally aren't, unless you are, say it with me, the Mongols. By calling some group civilizations, you imply that all other social orders are uncivilized, which is basically just another way of saying that they're savages or barbarians. Side note, originally Greek, the word barbarian denoted anyone who did not speak ancient Greek, because to the Greeks, all other languages sounded like Barbara Bar. So that is to say that we are all essentially barbarians except for the classics majors, which is worth remembering when we're discussing civilizations. Civilizations are like most of the things we like to study. They're intellectual constructs. No one woke up in the city of Thebes in Egypt one morning and said, what a beautiful morning. I sure am living at the height of Egyptian civilization. Still, they're useful constructs, particularly when you're comparing one civilization to another. They're less useful when you're comparing a civilization to a non civilization type social order, which is why we will try to avoid that. And yes, I am getting to the good boyfriend stuff.

Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best known, with dense multi story homes constructed out of uniformly sized bricks along perpendicular streets. I mean, this wasn't some ancient world version of Houston, more like Chicago. This means they must have had some form of government and zoning, but we don't know what gave this government its authority. Cities were oriented to catch the wind and provide a natural form of air conditioning. And they were clean. Most homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste and water out of the city in big sewer ditches that ran under the main avenues. A plumbing system that would have been the envy of many 18th century European cities. Also in Mahanja Dara, the largest public building was not a temple or a palace, but a public bath, which historians call the Great Bath. We don't know what the Great Bath was used for, but since later Indian culture placed a huge emphasis on ritual purity, which is the basis for the caste system, some historians have speculated that the bath might have been like a giant baptismal pool. Also, they traded one of the coolest things that the Indus Valley civilization produced were seals used as identification markers on goods and clay tablets. These seals contain the writing that we still can't decipher and a number of fantastic designs, many featuring animals and monsters. One of the most famous and frightening is of a man with what looks like water buffalo horns on his head, sitting cross legged between a tiger and a bull. We don't know what's really going on here, but it's safe to say that this was a powerful dude, because he seems to be able to control the tiger. How did these seals let us know that they traded? Well, because we found them in Mesopotamia, not the Indus Valley. Plus, archaeologists have found stuff like bronze in the Indus Valley that is not native to the region. So what did they trade? Cotton cloth. Still such a fascinating export incidentally that it will be the subject of the final video in this very series.

Snails make excellent domesticated food sources, by the way, because A, surprisingly caloric, b they're easy to carry, since they come with their own suitcases, and C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters. That's not really a revolution. That's just people trying to increase available calories. But one non revolution leads to another, and pretty soon you have this as far as the eye can see. Many historians also argue that without agriculture, we wouldn't have all the bad things that come with complex civilizations like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine. And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser. Without it, humans never would have changed the environment so much, building dams and clearing forests and more recently, drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer. Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean it was the right choice? Maybe so and maybe not. But regardless, we can't unmake that choice. And that's one of the reasons I think it's so important to study history. History reminds us that revolutions are not events so much as their processes.

Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records, but they love to make guesses. Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture, even though it was more work or abundance, gave people leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility, right? Or, as some historians have argued, people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol. Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying a wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise old savage. Off topic, but you will note in the coming weeks that the definition of savage tends to be not me. Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more. Like, early huntergatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted, and when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it. Unless it's just food, then you want to do less of it. A caramel spit out, oh, that's much better. So early farmers would find the most accessible forms of wheat and plant them and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like, you know, it would be awesome.\"],\n",

And this meant that a new group of rulers had to rise up to take their place, often with very little experience in governance. I mean, zimbabwe's long serving dictator. Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher. Let that be a lesson to you. Your teachers may have dictatorial ambitions, but most strong men have emerged, of course, from the military. Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo, which he held from 1965 until his death in 1997. Idi Amin was military dictator of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Moamar Gaddafi ruled Libya from 1977 until 2011. The list goes on. But I don't want to give you the wrong impression about Africa. Because while the continent does have less freedom and lower levels of development than other regions in the world, many African nations show strong and consistent signs of growth, despite the challenges of decolonization. Botswana, for instance, has gone from 70% literacy to 85% in the past 15 years and has seen steady GDP growth over 5%. Benin's economy has grown in each of the past twelve years, which is better than Europe or the US. Can say. In 2002, Kenya's life expectancy was 47. Today, it's 63. Ethiopia's per capita GDP has doubled over the past ten years, and Mauritania has seen its infant mortality rate fall by more than 40%. Now, this progress is spotty and fragile, but it's important to note that these nations have existed, on average, about 13 years less than my dad.

In Vietnam, the French fought communist led nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh, from almost the moment World War II ended until 1954, when the French were defeated. And then the Americans heard that there was a land war available in Asia, so they quickly took over from the French. And Communists did not fully control Vietnam until 1975. Despite still being ostensibly Communist, vietnam now manufactures all kinds of stuff that we like in America, especially sneakers. More about that next week, too. But now to Egypt. You'll remember that Egypt bankrupted itself in the 19th century, trying to industrialize, and ever since had been ruled by an Egyptian king who took his orders from the British. So while technically Egypt had been independent since 1922, it was very dependent independence. But that changed in the 1950s, when the king was overthrown by the army. The army commander who led that coup was Gamal Abdul Nasr, who proved brilliant at playing the US and the USSR off each other to the benefit of Egypt. Nasser's was a largely secular nationalism, and he and his successors saw one of the other antiimperialistic nationalist forces in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, as a threat. So once in power, Nasr and the army banned the Muslim Brotherhood, forcing it underground, where it would disappear and never become an issue again. Wait, what's that? Really? And finally, let's turn to central and southern Africa. One of the most problematic legacies of colonialism was its geography. Colonial boundaries became redefined as the borders of new nation states, even where those boundaries were arbitrary or in some cases, pernicious. The best known example is in Rwanda, where two very different tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsis, were combined into one nation. But more generally, the colonizers focus on value extraction really hurt these new nations. Europeans claimed to bring civilization and economic development to their colonies, but this economic development focused solely on building infrastructure to get resources and export them. Now, whether European powers deliberately sabotage development in Africa is a hot button topic we're going to stay well away from. But this much is inarguably true. When the Europeans left, african nations did not have the institutions necessary to thrive in the postwar industrial world. They had very few schools, for instance, and even fewer universities, like when the Congo achieved independence from Belgium in 1960, there were 16 Congolese college graduates in a nation of 14 million people.\"]]"
