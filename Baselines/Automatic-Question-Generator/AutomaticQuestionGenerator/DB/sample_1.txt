Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to
0:04
do some legitimate comp. civ., for those of you into that kind of thing. Stan, I can't
0:07
help but feel that we have perhaps too many globes. That's better.
0:10
Today we're going to learn about the horrible totalitarian Persians and the saintly, democracy-loving
0:16
Greeks. But of course we already know this story - there were some wars in which no
0:19
one wore any shirts, and everyone was reasonably fit. The Persians were bad; the Greeks were
0:23
good. Socrates and Plato were awesome; the Persians didn't even philosophize. The West
0:28
is the Best; Go Team! Yeah, well, no.
0:31
[theme music]
0:39
Let's start with the Persian empire, which became the model for pretty much all land-based
0:43
empires throughout the world. Except for - wait for it - the Mongols. [Mongoltage]
0:50
Much of what we know about the Persians and their empire comes from an outsider writing
0:54
about them, which is something we now call history, and one of the first true historians
0:58
was Herodotus, whose famous book The Persian Wars talks about the Persians quite a bit.
1:03
Now the fact that Herodotus was a Greek is important because it introduces us to the
1:06
idea of historical bias. But more on that in a second.
1:09
So the Persian Achaemenid dynasty... Achaemenid? Hold on...
1:12
HowJSay: AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid
1:14
They're both right? I was right twice!?
1:17
Right, so the Persian AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid dynasty was founded in 539 BCE by King Cyrus
1:22
the Great. Cyrus took his nomadic warriors and conquered most of Mesopotamia, including
1:26
the Babylonians, which ended a sad period in Jewish history called The Babylonian Exile,
1:31
thus ensuring that Cyrus got great press in the Bible.
1:34
But his son, Darius the First, was even greater, he extended Persian control east to our old
1:38
friend the Indus Valley, west to our new friend Egypt, and north to Crash Course newcomer
1:44
Anatolia. By the way, there were Greeks in Anatolia called Ionian Greeks who will become relevant shortly.
1:48
So even if you weren't Persian, the Persian Empire was pretty dreamy. For one thing, the
1:52
Persians ruled with a light touch, like, conquered kingdoms were allowed to keep their kings
1:55
and their elites as long as they pledged allegiance to the Persian King and paid taxes, which
2:00
is why the Persian king was known as The King of Kings.
2:02
Plus, taxes weren't too high, and the Persians improved infrastructure with better roads
2:06
and they had this pony express-like mail service of which Herodotus said: "...they are stayed
2:10
neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from accomplishing their appointed course with all speed."
2:18
And the Persians embraced freedom of religion. Like they were Zoroastrian, which has a claim
2:22
to being the world's first monotheistic religion. It was really Zoroastrianism that
2:26
introduced to the good/evil dualism we all know so well. You know: god and Satan, or
2:31
Harry and Voldemort... But the Persians weren't very concerned about converting people of
2:34
the empire to their faith. Plus, Zoroastrianism forbid slavery, and so slavery was almost
2:40
unheard of in the Persian Empire.
2:42
All in all, if you had to live in the 5th century BCE, the Persian Empire was probably
2:46
the best place to do it. Unless, that is, you believe Herodotus and the Greeks. We all
2:50
know about the Greeks: architecture, philosophy, literature. The very word music comes from
2:55
Greek, as does so much else in contemporary culture. Greek poets and mathematicians playwrights
3:00
and architects and philosophers founded a culture we still identify with. And they introduced
3:05
us to many ideas, from democracy to fart jokes. And the
3:09
Greeks gave the west our first dedicated history, they gave us our vocabulary for talking about politics.
3:13
Plus they gifted us our idealization of democracy, which comes from the government they had in Athens.
3:18
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green - did you say fart jokes?
3:21
Present John: Uhh. You don't ask about Doric, Ionian, or Corinthian columns. You don't
3:25
ask about Plato's allegory of the cave. It's all scatological humor with you - It's
3:30
time for the open letter? Really? Already? Alright.
3:34
An open letter [the whoopee cushion sounds]... Stan! To Aristophanes. Dear Aristophanes...
3:38
Oh right, I have to check the secret compartment. Stan, what... oh. Thank you, Stan. It's
3:46
fake dog poo. How thoughtful.
3:48
So, good news and bad news, Aristophanes.
3:50
2,300 years after your death - this is the good news - you're still a reasonably
3:53
famous. Only eleven of your forty plays survived, but even so, you're called the Father of
3:58
Comedy; there are scholars devoted to your work.
4:01
Now, the bad news: Even though your plays are well-translated and absolutely hilarious,
4:06
students don't like to read them in schools. There always like, why do we gotta read this
4:10
boring crap? And this must be particularly galling to you, because so much of what you
4:14
did in your career was make fun of boring crap, specifically in the form of theatrical
4:19
tragedies. Plus, you frequently used actual crap to make jokes. Such as when you had the
4:24
chorus in The Acharnians imagining a character in your play throwing crap at a real poet you didn't like.
4:29
You, Aristophanes, who wrote that under every stone lurks a politician, who called wealth
4:33
the most excellent of all the gods... You, who are responsible for the following conversation:
4:38
"Praxagora: I want all to have a share of everything and everything to be in common;
4:41
there will no longer be either rich or poor; [...] I shall begin by making land, money,
4:47
everything that is private property, common to all. [...]
4:50
Blepyrus: But who will till the soil?
4:51
Praxagora: The slaves.
4:52
Blepyrus: Oh."
4:53
And yet you're seen as homework! Drudgery! That, my friend, is a true tragedy. On the
4:59
upside, we did take care of slavery. It only took us two thousand years.
5:02
Best wishes, John Green
5:04
When we think about the high point of Greek culture, exemplified by the Parthenon and
5:07
the plays of Aeschylus, what we're really thinking about is Athens in the fourth century
5:11
BCE, right after the Persian Wars. But Greece was way more than Athens; Greeks lived in
5:16
city-states which consisted of a city and its surrounding area. Most of these city-states
5:20
featured at least some form of slavery, and in all of them citizenship was limited to males. Sorry ladies...
5:27
Also, each of the city-states had its own form of government, ranging from very democratic
5:31
- unless you were a woman or a slave - to completely dictatorial. And the people who
5:35
lived in these cities considered themselves citizens of that city, not of anything that
5:39
would ever be called Greece. At least until the Persian wars.
5:44
So between 490 and 480 BCE, the Persians made war on the Greek City states. This was the
5:48
war that featured the battle of Thermopylae where three hundred brave Spartans battled
5:53
- if you believe Herodotus - five million Persians.
5:56
And also the battle of Marathon, which is a plain about 26.2 miles away from Athens.
6:01
The whole war started because Athens supported those aforementioned Ionian Greeks when they
6:05
were rebelling in Anatolia against the Persians. That made the Persian king Xerxes mad, so
6:10
he led two major campaigns against the Athenians, and the Athenians enlisted the help of all
6:15
the other Greek city-states. And in the wake of that shared Greek victory, the Greeks began
6:19
to see themselves as Greeks, rather than as Spartans, or Athenians or whatever.
6:23
And then Athens emerged as the de facto capital of Greece and then got to experience a Golden
6:27
Age, which is something that historians make up. But a lot of great things did happen during
6:30
the Golden Age, including the Parthenon, a temple that became a church and then a mosque
6:34
and then an armory until finally settling into its current gig as a ruin.
6:38
You also had statesmen like Pericles, whose famous funeral oration brags about the golden
6:42
democracy of Athens with rhetoric that wouldn't sound out of place today. "If we look to
6:47
the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences... if a man is
6:51
able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition."
6:56
When you combine that high-minded rhetoric with the undeniable power and beauty of the
7:00
art and philosophy that was created in ancient Athens, it's not hard to see it as the foundation
7:06
of Western civilization. And if you buy into this, you have to be glad that the Greeks
7:09
won the Persian Wars. But even if you put aside the slavery and other injustices in
7:13
Greek society, there's still trouble.
7:15
Do I have to say it, seriously? FINE. TROUBLE RIGHT HERE IN RIVER CITY WITH A CAPITAL T
7:19
AND THAT RHYMES WITH P AND THAT STANDS FOR PELOPONNESE.
7:21
Pericles's funeral oration comes from a later war, The Peloponnesian War, a thirty
7:26
year conflict between the Athenians and the Spartans. The Spartans did not embrace democracy
7:32
but instead embraced a kingship that functioned only because of a huge class of brutally mistreated
7:38
slaves. But to be clear, the war was not about Athens trying to get Sparta to embrace democratic
7:42
reform; wars rarely are. It was about resources and power. And the Athenians were hardly saintly
7:48
in all of this, as evidenced by the famous Melian Dialogue. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
7:52
So in one of the most famous passages of Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians
7:56
sailed to the island of Melos, a Spartan colony, and demanded that the Melians submit to Athenian
8:01
rule. The Melians pointed out that they'd never actually fought with the Spartans and
8:05
were like, "Listen, if it's all the same to you, we'd like to go Switzerland on this
8:09
one," except of course they didn't say that because there was no Switzerland.
8:11
To which the Athenians responded, and here I am quoting directly, "The strong do what
8:16
they can, and the weak suffer what they must."
8:20
Needless to say, this is not a terribly democratic or enlightened position to take. This statement,
8:25
in fact, is sometimes seen as the first explicit endorsement of the so-called theory of Realism
8:30
in international relations. For realists, interaction between nations, or peoples, or
8:35
cultures is all about who has the power. Whoever has it can compel whoever doesn't have it
8:41
to do pretty much anything.
8:43
So what did the meritocratic and democratic Athenians do when the Melians politely asked
8:48
not to participate in the fight? They killed all the Melian men and enslaved all the women and children.
8:54
So, yes, Socrates gave us his interrogative Method; Sophocles gave us Oedipus; but the
8:59
legacy of Ancient Greece is profoundly ambiguous, all the moreso because the final winner of
9:04
the Peloponnesian War were the dictatorial Spartans. Thanks for the incredible bummer, Thought Bubble.
9:09
So here's a non-rhetorical question: Did the right side win the Persian wars?
9:13
Most classicists and defenders of the Western Tradition will tell you that of course we
9:17
should be glad the Greeks won. After all, winning the Persian war set off the cultural
9:20
flourishing that gave us the Classical Age. And plus, if the Persians had won with their
9:24
monarchy that might have strangled democracy in its crib and given us more one-man rule.
9:30
And that's possible, but as a counter that argument, let's consider three things:
9:33
First, it's worth remembering that life under the Persians was pretty good, and if
9:36
you look at the last five thousand years of human history, you'll find a lot more successful
9:41
and stable empires than you will democracies.
9:44
Second, life under the Athenians wasn't so awesome, particularly if you were a woman
9:48
or a slave, and their government was notoriously corrupt. And ultimately the Athenian government
9:52
derived its power not from its citizens, but from the imperialist belief that Might Makes
9:57
Right. It's true that Athens gave us Socrates, but let me remind you, they also killed him.
10:02
Well, I mean they forced him to commit suicide. Whatever, Herodotus, you're not the only
10:06
one here who can engage in historical bias.
10:08
And lastly, under Persian rule the Greeks might have avoided the Peloponnesian War,
10:11
which ended up weakening the Greek city-states so much that Alexander "Coming Soon" the
10:15
Great's father was able to conquer all of them, and then there were a bunch of bloody
10:18
wars with the Persians and all kinds of horrible things, and Greece wouldn't glimpse democracy
10:23
again for two millennia. All of which might have been avoided if they'd just let themselves
10:27
get beaten by the Persians.
10:29
All of which forces us to return to the core question of human history: What's the point
10:33
of being alive? I've got good news for you, guy. You're only going to have to worry
10:38
about it for about 8 more seconds. Should we try to ensure the longest, healthiest,
10:41
and most productive lives for humans? If so, it's easy to argue that Greece should have
10:46
lost the Persian Wars. But perhaps lives are to be lived in pursuit of some great ideal
10:50
worth sacrificing endlessly for. And if so, maybe the glory of Athens still shines, however dimly.
10:57
Those are the real questions of history: What's the point of being alive? How should we organize
11:00
ourselves, what should we seek from this life? Those aren't easy questions, but we'll
11:05
take another crack at them next week when we talk about the Buddha. I'll see you then.
