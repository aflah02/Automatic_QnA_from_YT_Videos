Hi there, my name’s John Green and this is Crash Course: World History, and today we’re going to talk about Egypt.
0:04
No, not that Egypt. Older.
0:07
Older. Older.
0:09
Less fictional. Yes, that one.
0:12
Ancient Egypt is probably the most influential of the river valley civilizations.
0:15
Like you might not recognize any Assyrian Kings or Assyrian language, but you probably do know King Tut.
0:21
And you may recognize that the Eye of Horus is right now staring at me and judging me.
0:25
I can feel, I can feel your judgement.
0:27

0:36
When we think of Ancient Civilizations, we think of Egypt.
0:39
There are a few reasons for this, like the fact that the pyramids are the last man standing among the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World.
0:45
But more importantly, Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted from 3000 BCE to 332 BCE.
0:53
That’s a period that historians call a long-ass time.
0:58
And I will remind you it is not cursing if I'm talking about donkeys.
1:01
So there are many approaches to the study of history. You could view history as a millennial
1:04
long conversation about philosophy or as clashes between great men or you can see history through
1:09
the lens of traditionally neglected populations, like women or indigenous peoples or slaves.
1:15
And we’re going to try to take many approaches to our study of history during Crash Course.
1:19
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which approach is right? I mean, for the test.
1:25
Oh me-from-the-past. Remember how you spent all of third year French writing notes back
1:29
and forth to that girl and she eventually agreed to go out with you and you did make
1:32
it to second base but now you can hardly parle un mot de francais?
1:36
Historical lenses are like that, my friend: With every choice, something is gained and something is lost.
1:41
Right, so in discussing agriculture and early civilizations, we’ve been approaching history
1:45
through the lens of resource distribution and geography.
1:48
And just as the violent and capricious Tigris and Euphrates rivers shaped the worldview
1:52
of early Mesopotamians, the Nile shaped the world view of the Egyptians. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
1:58
The Nile was regular, navigable, and benign, making for one of the safest and richest agricultural
2:03
areas in the world. Each summer the river flooded the fields at precisely the right
2:07
time, leaving behind nutrient-rich silt for planting season.
2:10
Planting was so easy that Egyptians just tossed seeds around the silty earth and then let
2:15
their cattle or pigs walk on it to press the seeds into the ground, and then boom, grain
2:20
and figs and wheat and pomegranates and melons and joy.
2:24
Unlike most river valley civilizations, Egyptian communities existed ONLY along the Nile, which
2:30
was navigable enough to get valuable resources downstream from timber to gold, which the Egyptians
2:36
considered the divine metal, thereby introducing an idea that would eventually culminate in Mr. T.
2:40
The Nile is also easily tamed. While other river valley civilizations needed complicated
2:45
and labor-intensive hydraulic engineering projects to irrigate crops, the Nile was so
2:50
chill that Egyptians could use a simple form of water management called basin irrigation,
2:54
in which farmers used floodwaters to fill earthen basins and canals for irrigation.
2:59
In short, the awesomeness of the Nile meant Egyptians could create big food surpluses
3:03
with relatively little work, allowing time and energy for some pretty impressive projects.
3:08
Also, the Nile may help explain the ancient Egypt’s general optimism:
3:12
While ancient Sumerian religion, for instance, saw the afterlife as this gloomy, dark place,
3:17
Egyptians were often buried with things that were useful and pleasurable to them in life,
3:22
because the Afterlife was seen as a continuation of this life, which, at least if you lived
3:27
along the Nile, wasn’t half-bad.
3:28
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
3:30
And now, my dear pupils, I shall terrorize you with the oppression of dates. No. Dates.
3:36
Yes. Thank you.
3:38
Historians have divided Egyptian history into three broad categories. Each with their own
3:42
numbered dynasties. But only hardcore Egyptologists know the dynasties, and we’re not trying
3:46
to become hardcore Egyptologists.
3:48
The Old Kingdom lasted from 2649 to 2152;
3:51
The middle kingdom from 2040 to 1640;
3:53
And the New Kingdom, so called because it is only 3,000 years old, lasted from 1550-1070 BCE.
3:58
In between you have a couple so-called Intermediate periods. Okay, OLD KINGDOM.
4:03
This was really the glory age of ancient Egypt, when we get all the stuff that will later
4:07
make Indiana Jones possible, like the pyramids at Giza, and the sun king Ra, and the idea of divine kingship.
4:13
The king, or Pharoh, was either a god or very close to a god.
4:17
which seems like a good gig, except that it meant that he wasn’t expected to act like
4:20
a person, he was expected to act like a god, which in ancient Egypt means acting like the
4:25
Nile: calm, cool, benevolent... There’s no fun it that.
4:30
And then of course there are the pyramids, which aside from remaining impressive to behold
4:34
represent a remarkable degree of political and social control over the population, because
4:39
it is not easy to convince people to devote their lives to building a sarcophagus for someone else.
4:44
The most famous pyramids were built between 2575 and 2465 BCE.
4:48
The one with the Sphinx was for Khephren;
4:51
the largest, the Great Pyramid, was built for the Pharaoh Khufu.
4:54
These pyramids were built partly by peasants who were required by Egyptian law to work
4:58
for the government a certain number of months per year,
5:01
and partly by slaves, but not by Moses and the Jews, who showed up on the scene long
5:05
before pyramids were ever even a twinkle in Khufu’s eye.
5:08
This leads to an overwhelming question: Why? Why in the sweet name of Ra would anyone ever
5:15
build such a thing?
5:17
Well, let’s start with Ra. So, Ra started out as a regional god, reigning over Heliopolis,
5:21
but he eventually became really central to the entire pantheon of gods of ancient Egypt.
5:25
He was the god of the sun, but also the god of creation.
5:28
And the thinking was that if humans did their jobs then the pantheon of gods would maintain
5:32
cosmic order, and since the pharaohs became gods upon their death, it made sense to please
5:38
them even unto pyramids.
5:40
Egyptian popular religion also embraced the belief in amulets and magic and divination
5:44
and the belief that certain animals--
5:46
especially cats—had divine power.
5:49
And yes, I did bring that up just so I could lolcat.
5:52
Old Kingdom Egypt was also remarkably literate:
5:54
They had two forms of writing, hieroglyphics for sacred writing and then demotic script
5:58
for recording contracts and agreements and other boring stuff.
6:02
The last thing I want to say about Old Kingdom Egypt; it was ridiculously rich.
6:05
But then around 2250 BCE there were a series of droughts and Pharaohs started fighting
6:10
over who should have power and we had an intermediate period.
6:13
[classic intermission music]
6:16
Which was followed by the Middle Earth...
6:18
No, what? The middle kingdom? Ohh. Really? That’s a bummer, Stan. I want it to be the
6:24
Middle Earth. How awesome would that be? Like right in the middle of Egyptian history, there
6:28
were Hobbits....
6:29
So the Middle Kingdom, which apparently had no Hobbits, restored Pharaonic rule in 2040
6:34
BCE but with some distinct changes:
6:36
First, the rulers were outsiders, from downriver in Nubia. Second, they fostered a new pantheon
6:41
of gods, the star of which was Ammun, which means hidden.
6:45
So here’s a little lesson from history: Hidden gods tend to do well because they’re omnipresent.
6:49
So Ammun eventually merged with Ra to form the god Ammun-Ra, who was like the best god ever
6:54
and all the Middle Kingdom pharaohs made temples for him and devoted all of their surplus to his glory.
7:01
The Middle Kingdom also developed an interest in conquering, specifically the new homeland
7:05
of Nubia, and they developed a side interest in getting conquered, specifically by Semitic
7:10
peoples from the Levant.
7:11
They were able to conquer much of Egypt using superior military technology like bronze weapons
7:15
and compound bows, and chariots of fire. What? They were just regular chariots? STAN WHY
7:21
ARE YOU ALWATS KILLING MY DREAMS?
7:23
One group, the Hyksos, were able to conquer all of Egypt, but rather than like destroying
7:28
the Egyptian culture, they just relaxed like the Nile and assimilated into the Egyptians.
7:33
And the Egyptians adopted their military technology. And then the Egyptians destroyed the Hyksos
7:38
and expelled them from Egypt.
7:39
And then by 1550 BCE there was again an Egyptian pharaoh, Ahmosis...
7:43
...whose name only sounds like an STD.
7:45
Anyway, after all this conquering and being conquered, Egypt eventually emerged from its
7:50
geographically imposed isolationism and, can you cue the New Kingdom Graphic please?
7:53
There it is!
7:55
New Kingdom Egypt continued this military expansion but it looked more like an Empire,
7:58
particularly when they headed south and took over land in an attempt to find gold and slaves.
8:03
Probably the most expansive of the New Kingdom pharaohs was Hatshepsut, a woman who ruled
8:08
Egypt for about 22 years.
8:10
And who expanded Egypt not through military might, but through trade.
8:14
But most new kingdom pharaohs being dudes, focused on military expansion, which brought
8:18
Egypt into conflicts with the Assyrians who you’ll remember from last week,
8:22
And then the Persians, and then Alexander the Great and finally, the Romans.
8:25
On the whole, Egypt probably would’ve been better off enjoying its geographical isolation
8:29
and not trying to conquer new territory, but all of Egypt’s friends had jumped off a bridge, so…
8:34
One last thing about the New Kingdom. There was this crazy New Kingdom Pharaoh named Akehenaten,
8:38
who tried to invent a new god for Egypt, Aten.
8:42
Akehenaten was kind of the Kim Jong Il of Ancient Egypt, like he had this feared police
8:46
force and this big cult of personality. And also he was a nut job.
8:50
Anyway, after his death he was replaced by his wife, and then a daughter and than a son,
8:55
Tutankaten, who turned his back on the weird god Aten and changed his name to Tutankhamen.
9:01
And that is about all King Tut did before he died...
9:04
...probably around the age of 17. Honestly, the only reason King Tut is famous is that
9:09
most Pharaohs had their graves robbed by ancient people; and King Tut had his grave robbed
9:15
by 20th century British people.
9:16
Which brings us to the Open Letter.
9:22
An Open Letter to King Tut:
9:24
Oh, but first we gotta find out what Stan left for me in the Secret Compartment. It’s a pen.
9:30
AAHHHH!! It’s a shock pen! Stan?%@#
9:33
That’s a terrible, terrible gift for the secret compartment.
9:37
Dear King Tut, I know that as Pharaohs lives go, yours was pretty poor. First, you had to marry your
9:42
sister, which hopefully you weren’t that psyched about, plus you had a cleft palette
9:46
and probably scoliosis.
9:49
Plus you died before really reaching adulthood. But dude, you have had the best afterlife ever.
9:53
Since your body was discovered in 1922, you’ve become probably the most famous ancient person.
9:59
There have been lots of books about you, scholars have devoted their lives to you.
10:03
Dude, we’re so obsessed with you that we used this fancy new technology to scan your
10:06
body and establish that you probably died of an infected broken leg and/or malaria,
10:11
So you’ve inspired such seminal works of art as the Discovery Kids series Tutenstein,
10:16
which my son forces me to watch.
10:17
Your relics have been to six continents! So it all works out in the end, man.
10:22
Well, I mean, you’re still dead. So that’s kinda sucks.
10:26
Best wishes, John Green
10:27
King Tut leads us nicely to the really crucial thing about Egyptian culture.
10:31
Because King Tut lived right around the same time as the pyramids right? Wrong.
10:34
Remember the pyramids were built around 2500 BCE during the Old Kingdom. King Tut died
10:41
in 1322 BCE, 1200 years later!
10:44
That’s five and a half Americas. But because Egypt was so similar for so long, it all tends
10:50
to blend together when we imagine it.
10:52
Ancient Egypt lasted 1000 years longer than Christianity has been around, and about 800
10:57
years longer than that other super-long lived civilization, China.
11:00
So there was an entire culture that lasted longer than Western Civilization has existed
11:05
and it had run its course before “the West” was even born.
11:08
Next week, we’ll look at the Persians and the Greeks. I’ll see you then.
