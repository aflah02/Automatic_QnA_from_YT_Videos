Hi there. I'm John Green, you're watching Crash Course World History, and today we're
0:03
going to talk about "Iraq" No, you purportedly smart globe. We're going to talk about Mesopotamia.
0:08
I love Mesopotamia because it helped create two of my favorite things: Writing and taxes.
0:13
Why do I like taxes? Because before taxes, the only certainty was death.
0:18
Mr. Green. Mr. Green, did you know that you're referencing Mark Twain?
0:21
I'm not referencing Mark Twain, me from the past, I'm referencing Benjamin Franklin,
0:25
who was probably himself quoting the unfortunately named playwright Christopher Bullock. Listen.
0:31
You may be smart, kid, but I've been smart longer. By the way, today's illustration
0:35
points out that an eye for an eye leaves the whole world monocular.
0:38
[theme music]
0:47
So 5,000 years ago in the land meso, or between, the Tigris and Euphrates potomoi, or rivers,
0:54
cities started popping up much like they had in our old friend the Indus River valley.
0:58
These early Mesopotamian cities engaged in a form of socialism, where farmers contributed
1:03
their crops to public storehouses out of which workers, like metalworkers or builders or
1:08
male models or whatever—would be paid uniform "wages" in grain. So, basically—
1:13
MR GREEN MR GREEN WERE THERE REALLY MALE MODELS? CAN YOU DO BLUE STEEL?
1:16
Oh younger version of myself, how I hate you.
1:23
Oh the humiliation I suffer for you people... that was my best Blue Steel.
1:27
That was as close as I can get.
1:29
So anyway, if you lived in a city, you could be something other than a shepherd, and thanks
1:32
to this proto-socialism you could be reasonably sure that you'd eat--
1:36
STAN, Is there any way we could get another globe in here? I feel like this shot is inadequately
1:41
globed. Yes, much better.
1:42
You know you can tell the quality of the historian by the number of his or her globes.
1:46
But even though you could give up your flock, a lot of people didn't want to.
1:49
One of the legacies of Mesopotamia is the enduring conflict between country and city.
1:55
You see this explored a lot in some of our greatest art such as
1:57
The Beverly Hillbillies and Deliverance, and the showdown between Enkidu and Gilgamesh
2:02
in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is one of the oldest known works of literature and
2:05
I'm not gonna spoil it for you— there's a link to the poem in the video
2:08
info—but suffice it to say that in the showdown between country and city, the city wins.
2:13
So what were these city states like? Well, let's take a look at one such city-state,
2:17
Gilgamesh's home town of Uruk, in the Thought Bubble:
2:20
Uruk was a walled city with an extensive canal system and several monumental temples, called ziggurats.
2:25
The priests of these temples initially had all the power, because they were able to communicate
2:29
directly with the gods.
2:31
That was a useful talent, because Mesopotamian gods were moody and frankly pretty mean—like,
2:35
according to Gilgamesh they once got mad at us because we were making too much noise while
2:39
they were trying to sleep so they decided to destroy all of humanity with a flood.
2:43
The Tigris and Euphrates are decent as rivers go, but Mesopotamia is no Indus Valley, with
2:49
its on-schedule flooding and easy irrigation.
2:52
A lot of slave labor was needed to make the Tigris and Euphrates useful for irrigation;
2:56
they're difficult to navigate and flood unpredictably and violently. Violent, unpredictable,
3:02
and difficult to navigate: Oh, Tigris and Euphrates, how you remind me of my college girlfriend.
3:07
So I mean given that the region tends to yo-yo between devastating flood and horrible drought,
3:12
it follows that one would believe that the gods are kind of random and capricious, and
3:17
that any priests who might be able to lead rituals that placate those gods would be very useful individuals.
3:24
But about 1000 years after the first temples we find in cities like Uruk, a rival structure
3:29
begins to show up, the palace.
3:31
The responsibility for the well-being and success of the social order was shifting from gods
3:36
to people, a power shift that will seesaw throughout human history until...um, probably forever actually.
3:42
But in another development we'll see again, these kings, who probably started out as military
3:47
leaders or really rich landowners, took on a quasi-religious role.
3:51
How? Often by engaging in "sacred marriage" -- specifically skoodilypooping with the
3:56
high priestess of the city's temple.
3:58
So the priests were overtaken by kings, who soon declared themselves priests.
4:02
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So how do we know that these kings were skoodilypooping with
4:05
lady priests? Because they made a skoodilypooping tape and put it on the internet. No, because
4:09
there's a written record. Mesopotamia gave us writing, specifically a form of writing
4:13
called cuneiform, which was initially created not to like woo lovers or whatever but to
4:18
record transactions like how many bushels of wheat were exchanged for how many goats.
4:23
I'm not kidding, by the way; a lot of cuneiform is about wheat and goats.
4:26
I don't think you can overestimate the importance of writing but let's just make three points here:
4:30
1. Writing and reading are things that not everyone can do. So they create a class distinction,
4:37
one that in fact survives to this day. Foraging social orders were relatively egalitarian;
4:41
but the Mesopotamians had slaves and they played this metaphorically resonant sport
4:45
that was like polo except instead of riding on horses you rode on other people.
4:51
And written language played an important role in widening the gap between classes.
4:54
2. Once writing enters the picture, you have actual history instead of just a lot of guesswork & archaeology.
5:00
3. Without writing, I would not have a job, so I'd like to personally thank Mesopotamia
5:05
for making it possible for me to work while reclining in my lay-z-boy.
5:09
So why did this writing happen in Mesopotamia? Well the fertile crescent, while it is fertile,
5:13
is lacking the pretty much everything else. In order to get metal for tools or stone for
5:18
sculptures or wood for burning, Mesopotamia had to trade. This trading eventually led
5:23
Mesopotamia to develop the world's first territorial kingdom, which will become very
5:27
important and will eventually culminate in some extraordinarily inbred Hapsburgs.
5:31
So the city state period in Mesopotamia ended around 2,000 BCE, probably because drought
5:36
and a shift in the course of rivers led to pastoral nomads coming in and conquering the
5:40
environmentally weakened cities. And then the nomads settled into cities of their own
5:44
as nomads almost always will unless—wait for it—
5:48
...You are the Mongols.
5:51
These new Mesopotamian city states were similar to their predecessors in that they had temples
5:56
and writing and their own self-glorifying stories but they were different in some important ways.
6:00
First, that early proto-socialism was replaced by something that looked a lot like private
6:04
enterprise, where people could produce as much as they would like as long as they gave
6:08
a cut, also known as taxes to the government. We talk a lot of smack about taxes but it
6:13
turns out they're pretty important to creating stable social orders.
6:16
Things were also different politically because the dudes who'd been the tribal chiefs became
6:19
like full-blown kings, who tried to extend their power outside of cities and also tried
6:24
to pass on their power to their sons.
6:26
The most famous of these early monarchs is Hammurabi or as I remember him from my high
6:30
school history class, "The Hammer of Abi". Hammurabi ruled the new kingdom of Babylon
6:35
from 1792 BCE to 1750 BCE.
6:38
Hammurabi's main claim to fame is his famous law code which established everything from like
6:42
the wages of ox drivers to the fact that the punishment for taking an eye should be having an eye taken.
6:49
Hammurabi's law code could be pretty insanely harsh. Like if a builder builds a shoddy building
6:53
and then the owner's son dies in a collapse, the punishment for that is the execution of
6:59
the builder's son. The kid's like, that's not fair! I'm just a kid. What did I do? You should kill my dad.
7:05
All of which is to say that Hammurabi's law code gives a new meaning to the phrase
7:08
tough on crime, but it did introduce the presumption of innocence. And in
7:12
the law code Hammurabi tried to portray himself in two roles that should sound familiar: shepherd and father.
7:17
"[I am] the shepherd who brings peace. My benevolent shade was spread over the city,
7:22
I held the peoples of Sumer and Akkad safely on my lap."
7:28
So again we see the authority for protection of the social order shifting to men, not gods,
7:33
which is important, but don't worry, it'll shift back.
7:35
Even though the territorial kingdoms like Babylon were more powerful than any cities
7:38
that had come before, and even though Babylon was probably the world's most populous city
7:42
during Hammurabi's rule, it wasn't actually that powerful, and keeping with the pattern
7:47
it was soon taken over by the formerly-nomadic Kassites.
7:50
The thing about Territorial kingdoms is that they relied on the poorest people to pay taxes,
7:54
and provide labor and serve in the army, all of which made you not like your king very
7:59
much so if you saw any nomadic invaders coming by you might just be like "Hey nomadic invaders!
8:04
Come on in; you seem better than the last guy."
8:07
Well, that was the case until the Assyrians came along, anyway. The Assyrians have a deserved
8:11
reputation for being the brutal bullies of Mesopotamia. But the Assyrians did give us an
8:15
early example of probably the most important and durable form of political organization
8:20
in world history, and also Star Wars history, the Empire.
8:24
The biggest problem with empires is that by definition
8:26
they're diverse and multi-ethnic, which makes them hard to unify.
8:30
So beginning around 911 BCE, the neo-Assyrian Empire grew from its hometowns of Ashur and
8:35
Nineveh to include the whole of Mesopotamia, the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean and
8:40
even, by 680 BCE, Egypt! They did this thanks to the most brutal, terrifying
8:45
and efficient army the world had ever seen. More adjectives describing my college girlfriend.
8:51
For one thing the army was a meritocracy. Generals weren't chosen based on who their
8:54
dads were, they were chosen based on if they were good at Generalling.
8:58
Stan, is generalling a word? [pauses, two thumbs up w answer] It is!
9:02
Also, they were super mean. Like they would deport hundreds of thousands of people to
9:05
separate them from their history and their familes and also moved skilled workers around
9:10
where they were most needed.Also the neo-Assyrians loved to find would-be rebels and lop off
9:14
their appendages. Particularly their noses for some reason. And there was your standard
9:18
raping and pillaging and torture, all of which was done in the name of Ashur, the great god
9:23
of the neo-Assyrians whose divine regent was the King.
9:26
Ashur, through the King, kept the world going, and as long as conquest continued the world
9:31
would not end. But if conquest ever stopped, the world would end and there would be rivers
9:36
of blood and weeping and gnashing of teeth. You know how apocalypses go.
9:39
The Assyrians spread this world view with propaganda like monumental architecture and
9:43
readings about how awesome the king was at public festivals, all of which were designed
9:47
to inspire awe in the Empire's subjects.
9:50
Oh that reminds me, ITS TIME FOR THE OPEN LETTER.
9:55
An Open Letter to the Word Awesome:
9:57
But first lets see what's in the Secret Compartment today. Oh, Stan is
10:01
this yellow cake uranium? You never find that in Mesopotamia...
10:05
Dear Awesome, I love you. Like most contemporary English speakers in fact, I probably love you a little
10:10
too much. The thing about you, awesome, is that awesome is just so awesomely awesome at being
10:16
awesome. So we lose track of what you really mean, awesome: You're not just cool, you're
10:21
terrifying and wonderful. You're knees-buckling, chest-tightening, fearful encounters with
10:28
something radically other- something that we know could both crush and bless us. That
10:33
is awe, and I apologize for having watered you down.
10:36
But seriously, you're awesome.
10:38
Best wishes, John Green
10:40
So what happened to the Assyrians? Well, first they extended their empire beyond their roads,
10:44
making administration impossible.
10:46
But maybe even more importantly, when your whole world view is based on the idea that
10:50
the apocalypse will come if you ever lose a battle, and then you lose one battle, the
10:56
whole world view just blows up. That eventually happened and in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh
11:01
was finally conquered, and the neo-Assyrian Empire had come to its end.
11:05
But the idea of Empire was just getting started. Next week we'll talk about mummies — oh,
11:09
I have to talk about other things too? Crap, I only want to talk about mummies. Anyway,
11:14
we'll be talking about [tapping stylus to talking globe replying Sudan] No! Dangit!
11:18
We'll actually be talking about [taps globe to reply Egypt] Thank you, Smart Globe.
11:22
See you next week.
