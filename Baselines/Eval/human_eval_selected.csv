"Hi. I'm John Green. This is crash course world history. And today we're going to talk about the Mughal empire and we're also going to talk about the two most important Mughal emperors akbar and Orangzeb and how their historical reputations were made. Mr. Green. Mr. Green. Don't you mean the Mongol empire? Oh me from the past. That reminds me of the time that you conflated the word fort with the word forte which of course you pronounced fort. But on this occasion you are weren't entirely wrong. The Mughals were kind of the Mongols but we'll get to that in a minute. So the Mughals were Muslims who created an empire in India that held power for roughly 200 years between the early 16th and early 18th centuries. Although technically the Mughal empire didn't come to an end until after the Indian rebellion against the British in 57. Now the Moguls weren't the first Muslims in India. Those would have been merchants and they weren't even the first Muslims to rule significant parts of India. That honor goes to the Delhi Sultanate which began in twelve six in northern India. But the Delhi sultanate didn't last very long. It was replaced by a bunch of regional kingdoms and one of them, the Lodai Sultanate had the misfortune of falling to the founder of the Mughal dynasty Babler in 1526. Not Babar, although that would have been awesome. Babler was descended from Timur, the last great central Asian conqueror in the Mongol tradition and also from Chinggis Khan. Which explains why Babar and his followers are called the Mongols. It's the Persian Arabic word for Mongols. Now I know what you're saying. Something like 12% of human beings currently living in the world are descended from Chinggis Khan's. But Baber got it on the ground floor of it. Anyway, I think we have some footage of Baba rating the Lodi Sultanate, don't we stand? I don't feel like that was actual file footage from twelve six. I feel like that was a racist Hercules movie from Italy in the 1950s. So the Mughal empire is really important in India's cultural history. I mean the Taj Mahal was built during this time. In architecture and painting we see a blending of Indian and Persian styles that demonstrate how cosmopolitan the empire was. But probably the most important aspect of the Moguls, at least as far as the contemporary world is concerned is that they consolidated Muslim rule over much of India and they're largely the reason that today there are so many Indians who are also Muslims.","['Who is John Green?', 'Who was the founder of the Mughal dynasty Babler?', 'What is the Persian Arabic word for Mongols?', 'How many people live in the world are descended from Chinggis Khan?']","[""At least as far as that whom is the contemporary world concerned is consolidated Muslim rule over much of India and they 're largely the reason that today there are so many indians who are also Muslims ?

"But the trend toward orthodoxy and away from Akbar's toleration had begun long before with his predecessor, Shah Jahan. He's best known for building the Taj Mahal. Good work, Stan. He built it by himself. Apparently he had some help, but the maintenance of the Taj Mahal took all the revenue from 30 villages. And maybe Aurangzeb's orthodoxy was less important than his desire to appear to be a sober and frugal leader. Orangzeb was also accused of destroying temples in 1669, although, in fact, they were just damaged. And this was primarily done to send a political message to opponents, not as an act of religious orthodox. He also tried to limit expenses at court by prohibiting the use of gold in men's garments. And he stopped the traditional practice of being weighed against gold on his birthday. Unlike Akbar, who was seen as being a patron of the arts, Orangzeb is remembered for getting rid of court musicians and poets. But he got rid of them because of financial constraints. Well, and also because of his interpretation of Islamic law. And that last point interests me. For those who want to see him negatively orangzeb's orthodox, islam had no room for musicians or poets. But it's also possible to see that decision as a prudent, cost saving measure. Here's another detail from Orangzeb's life that's been used to paint him as a zealot. Orangzeb, unlike his predecessors, was buried in a simple outdoor grave rather than an elaborate and expensive tomb. You could see that as a symbol of religious faith or as a sign of humility or an attempt by a thoughtful ruler to spare his subject the expenses of like keeping up his tomb. That said, in the long run, the Taj Mahal has done pretty well in terms of generating tourist money, whereas I don't think anyone's paying to see Orangzeb's grave. But the thing is, Orangzeb needed to save money. If he was a bad ruler, it's mostly because he spent so much time and treasure fighting rebellions in the south of his empire and then neglected the north, where unrest grew as well. It's overly simplistic to say that the glory days of the Mughal empire were about tolerance and the downfall was about intolerance. Really, there were lots of factors that played into the decline of the Mughal empire, including growing factionalism at the Mughal court, the rise of regional powers, and the breakdown of the system of governance by local nobles. Historians are in the business of making claims about what happened and supporting those claims with evidence. And often this evidence provides the details that make reading and learning about history so much fun.","[""Who was Shah Jahan's predecessor?"", 'Who built the Taj Mahal?', ""What was Aurangzeb's orthodoxy less important than his desire to appear as a sober and frugal leader?"", 'Orangzeb was accused of destroying temples in what year?']","[""The Taj Mahal has done pretty well in whatof generating tourist money , that said , in the long run , whereas you do n't think anyone 's paying to see Orangzeb 's grave ?

"We see this in attempts at reform like the Tanzania and the Ottoman Empire. Ala ghani initially echoed these calls to study more science and philosophy. But his comparison of philosophers with profits was too radical for the Ottomans and he ended up being expelled from Istanbul. Chinese intellectuals responded similarly to the humiliation of the Opium Wars with calls for self strengthening, a phrase coined by its biggest supporter, Fenglifeng. Given China's almost 2000 year history of an education system based on confucian values and classical texts, which, to be fair, had worked pretty well for them for most of that time, adopting Western models of education and organization was going to be a tough sell. As Yan Fu, a Chinese writer and translator, put it, china governs the realm through filial piety, while westerns govern the realm with impartiality. China values the sovereign, while Westerners esteem the people. China prizes the one way, while Westerners prefer diversity in learning, chinese praise breadth of wisdom, while Westerners rely on human strength. One Chinese reformer, Kenya Wei, took up the challenge of blending western and Chinese ideas of governance by attempting to update Confucianism for the modern world and arguing that political reform and mass mobilization were central concerns for Confucius himself. Thanks thought bubble. So all of that gets to a big question. Imperialism was a disaster for a lot of people, but there were things about what the west was doing to control much of the world that were obviously working. So the question for people outside the west became what, if anything, do we take from this and try to borrow and integrate into our own communities? Well, in addition to education and military reforms, many Asian intellectuals felt that Europe's strength was rooted in its political organization into nation states. That sounds a lot like today's historians and also economists. Everyone's crazy about nation states except the Mongols. And you know what? I stand with the Mongols on that. I think empire is underrated. I would make an excellent emperor. For instance, you know what they'd call me? Stan genghis. John. Anybody? Yeah, I hate myself. But anyway, some of these intellectuals became proponents of nationalism. Like by 1879, Alf Ghani was advocating that Muslims begin to think of themselves as a nation in the sense of a culturally unified people. Here he is in words that recall the German nationalists of the time there is no happiness except through nationality, and no nationality except through language. A people without unity and a people without literature are a people without language. A people without history are a people without glory, and a people will lack history if authorities do not rise among them to protect and revivify the memory of their historical heroes so that they may follow and emulate.","['What did Ala ghani think was too radical for the Ottomans?', 'Why did Chinese intellectuals respond similarly to the humiliation of the Opium Wars with calls for self strengthening?', 'Who was the biggest supporter of Fenglifeng?', ""What did some Asian intellectuals feel Europe's strength was rooted in?""]","['But his comparison of philosophers with profits was too radical for whatottomans and he ended up being expelled from Istanbul ?

"Like his favorite Quranic injunction was god does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition. In China, Lang Chikao came up with a different source of reform the strong state. After the failure of the Boxer Rebellion. In 19 one, he wrote his awesomely titled on the New Rules for Destroying Countries. This was a critique of European imperialism, but it was also a call for a strong, somewhat authoritarian state that could stand up to the west. That China would never do that. Oh, wait, wait a second. They did. Eventually, he came to the conclusion that the Chinese people must now accept authoritarian rule. They cannot enjoy freedom. Well, that's pretty extreme. Oh, it's time for the open letter. But first, let's see what's in the globe today. Oh, look, it's some underappreciated authoritarian rulers. An open letter to authoritarianism. Dear Authoritarianism, listen, I am all for democracy, but the tyranny of the majority is no joke. And there have been many times when democratically elected governments were less pluralistic than authoritarian ones. Not only that, if you can keep corruption out of it, there is an astonishing efficiency to doing it your way. Like, who's going to make this decision? Oh, I know. The Queen. It's always the queen. No need for exploratory committees or different houses of Congress. The queen can do it. Maybe I'm just a little frustrated with congressional gridlock authoritarianism, but I kind of think you're underrated. Best wishes, John Green. He just want to confirm that I'm not advocating for authoritarian rule in the United States. So Lange also visited the United States, which made him more convinced that liberal democracies did not provide an answer, especially because they discriminated so much against Asians. And then World War I and the insane map drawing spree of the Treaty of Versailles just further confirmed all of it. I mean, despite the lofty rhetoric of Woodrow Wilson's 14 points in the League of nations, and everything the result of the war looked suspiciously like the prewar imperialism that many Asians believed was a cause of the war in the first place. But perhaps no one was more skeptical of the if you can't fight them, emulate them strategy of dealing with imperialism than Indians. Gandhi, for instance, went very far in his critique of the West's modernism, saying that it lacked spiritual freedom and social harmony, even rejecting many aspects of the Industrial Revolution itself. I mean, this was a person who sewed his own clothes. And interestingly, one of the most vocal Indian critics of the west was the one who was perhaps most positively received there. Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for a body of work that essentially said, you guys are terrible at everything.","[""What was Lang Chikao's favorite Quranic injunction?"", 'In what year did he write his awesomely titled on the New Rules for Destroying Countries?', 'What did Lange believe was a cause of the war?', 'How many points did Woodrow Wilson have in the League of nations?']","['He just want to confirm for what t that you you not advocating in the United states ?

"Hi. I'm John Green and this is Crash Course World History. Let's begin today with a question why am I alive? Also, why don't I have any eyes? Oh, that's better. The way we answer that question ends up organizing all kinds of other thoughts, like what we should value and how we should behave, and if we should eat meat, and whether we should dump that boy who is very nice but insanely clingy in a way that he cannot possibly think is attractive. All of which, Mr. Green, Mr. Green? Are you you talking about me? Yes, I am talking about you. Me from the past. I am telling you that one of the reasons we study history is so that you can be a less terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily. Today we're going to talk about civilizations. But in order to do that, we have to talk about talking about civilizations, because it's a problematic word. So problematic, in fact, that I have to turn to camera two to discuss it. Certain conglomerations of humans are seen as civilizations, whereas, say, nomadic cultures generally aren't, unless you are, say it with me, the Mongols. By calling some group civilizations, you imply that all other social orders are uncivilized, which is basically just another way of saying that they're savages or barbarians. Side note, originally Greek, the word barbarian denoted anyone who did not speak ancient Greek, because to the Greeks, all other languages sounded like Barbara Bar. So that is to say that we are all essentially barbarians except for the classics majors, which is worth remembering when we're discussing civilizations. Civilizations are like most of the things we like to study. They're intellectual constructs. No one woke up in the city of Thebes in Egypt one morning and said, what a beautiful morning. I sure am living at the height of Egyptian civilization. Still, they're useful constructs, particularly when you're comparing one civilization to another. They're less useful when you're comparing a civilization to a non civilization type social order, which is why we will try to avoid that. And yes, I am getting to the good boyfriend stuff. Patience, grasshopper. So what is a civilization?","['What is Crash Course World History?', 'Who is John Green?', 'What are some of the reasons we study history?', 'How are certain conglomerations of humans seen as civilizations?', 'Why are civilizations like most of the things we like to study?']","['Who can be a less terrible boyfriend , but more on that momentarily ?

"Yeah, although, come to think of it, either would be acceptable. So here's what we know. They had amazing cities. Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best known, with dense multi story homes constructed out of uniformly sized bricks along perpendicular streets. I mean, this wasn't some ancient world version of Houston, more like Chicago. This means they must have had some form of government and zoning, but we don't know what gave this government its authority. Cities were oriented to catch the wind and provide a natural form of air conditioning. And they were clean. Most homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste and water out of the city in big sewer ditches that ran under the main avenues. A plumbing system that would have been the envy of many 18th century European cities. Also in Mahanja Dara, the largest public building was not a temple or a palace, but a public bath, which historians call the Great Bath. We don't know what the Great Bath was used for, but since later Indian culture placed a huge emphasis on ritual purity, which is the basis for the caste system, some historians have speculated that the bath might have been like a giant baptismal pool. Also, they traded one of the coolest things that the Indus Valley civilization produced were seals used as identification markers on goods and clay tablets. These seals contain the writing that we still can't decipher and a number of fantastic designs, many featuring animals and monsters. One of the most famous and frightening is of a man with what looks like water buffalo horns on his head, sitting cross legged between a tiger and a bull. We don't know what's really going on here, but it's safe to say that this was a powerful dude, because he seems to be able to control the tiger. How did these seals let us know that they traded? Well, because we found them in Mesopotamia, not the Indus Valley. Plus, archaeologists have found stuff like bronze in the Indus Valley that is not native to the region. So what did they trade? Cotton cloth. Still such a fascinating export incidentally that it will be the subject of the final video in this very series. But here's the most amazing thing about the Indus Valley people they were peaceful.","['What is the name of the city in which Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best known?', 'What is one of the coolest things that the Indus Valley civilization produced?', 'Who traded seals used as identification markers on goods and clay tablets?']","[""Who was n't some ancient world version of Houston , more like Chicago ?

"In the francave, there's a huge pile of snail shells. Most of them are larger than current snails, suggesting that the people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious. Snails make excellent domesticated food sources, by the way, because A, surprisingly caloric, b they're easy to carry, since they come with their own suitcases, and C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters. That's not really a revolution. That's just people trying to increase available calories. But one non revolution leads to another, and pretty soon you have this as far as the eye can see. Many historians also argue that without agriculture, we wouldn't have all the bad things that come with complex civilizations like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine. And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser. Without it, humans never would have changed the environment so much, building dams and clearing forests and more recently, drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer. Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean it was the right choice? Maybe so and maybe not. But regardless, we can't unmake that choice. And that's one of the reasons I think it's so important to study history. History reminds us that revolutions are not events so much as their processes. That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today. Just as today, we're making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people of the future will remember as revolutions. Next week, we're going to journey to the Indus River Valley. Whoa. It's very fragile.

"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger. Thanks. Secret compartment? Just kidding. I don't thank you for this. An open letter to elephants. Hey, elephants. You're so cute and smart and awesome. Why you got to be pregnant for 22 months? That's crazy. And then you only have one kid. If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now. Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage being useful to humans, like here is a graph of cow population. And here is a graph of elephant population. Elephants, if you just inserted yourself into human life the way cows did, you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies, conspiring against the humans. And then you could have risen up and destroyed us and made an awesome elephant world with elephant cars and elephant planes, it would have been so great. But no, you got to be pregnant for 22 months and then have just one kid. It's so annoying. Best wishes, John Green right, but back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred. Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records, but they love to make guesses. Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture, even though it was more work or abundance, gave people leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility, right? Or, as some historians have argued, people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol. Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying a wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise old savage. Off topic, but you will note in the coming weeks that the definition of savage tends to be not me. Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more. Like, early huntergatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted, and when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it. Unless it's just food, then you want to do less of it. A caramel spit out, oh, that's much better. So early farmers would find the most accessible forms of wheat and plant them and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like, you know, it would be awesome.","['What is another double cheeseburger?', 'What is an open letter to elephants?', 'Why did you get pregnant for 22 months?', 'How many kid did you have?', 'Who believed agriculture was an accident?']","['What the greatest evolutionary advantage being like here being of cow population ?

"Most Europeans didn't rule their African possessions directly, but rather through the proxies of local rulers. And once Europeans left those local rulers, the upper classes were seen as illegitimate collaborators. And this meant that a new group of rulers had to rise up to take their place, often with very little experience in governance. I mean, zimbabwe's long serving dictator. Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher. Let that be a lesson to you. Your teachers may have dictatorial ambitions, but most strong men have emerged, of course, from the military. Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo, which he held from 1965 until his death in 1997. Idi Amin was military dictator of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Moamar Gaddafi ruled Libya from 1977 until 2011. The list goes on. But I don't want to give you the wrong impression about Africa. Because while the continent does have less freedom and lower levels of development than other regions in the world, many African nations show strong and consistent signs of growth, despite the challenges of decolonization. Botswana, for instance, has gone from 70% literacy to 85% in the past 15 years and has seen steady GDP growth over 5%. Benin's economy has grown in each of the past twelve years, which is better than Europe or the US. Can say. In 2002, Kenya's life expectancy was 47. Today, it's 63. Ethiopia's per capita GDP has doubled over the past ten years, and Mauritania has seen its infant mortality rate fall by more than 40%. Now, this progress is spotty and fragile, but it's important to note that these nations have existed, on average, about 13 years less than my dad. Of course, past experience with the fall of empires hasn't given us much cause for hope, but many citizens of these new nations are seeing real progress. That said, disaster might lurk around the corner. It's hard to say. I mean, now more than ever, we're trying to tell the story of humans from inside the story of humans. Thanks for watching.

"Over in the French colonies of Indochina, so called because they were neither Indian nor Chinese, things were even more violent. The end of colonization was disastrous in Cambodia, where the 17 year reign of Noradam Sianu gave way to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, which massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia's population between 1975 and 1979. In Vietnam, the French fought communist led nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh, from almost the moment World War II ended until 1954, when the French were defeated. And then the Americans heard that there was a land war available in Asia, so they quickly took over from the French. And Communists did not fully control Vietnam until 1975. Despite still being ostensibly Communist, vietnam now manufactures all kinds of stuff that we like in America, especially sneakers. More about that next week, too. But now to Egypt. You'll remember that Egypt bankrupted itself in the 19th century, trying to industrialize, and ever since had been ruled by an Egyptian king who took his orders from the British. So while technically Egypt had been independent since 1922, it was very dependent independence. But that changed in the 1950s, when the king was overthrown by the army. The army commander who led that coup was Gamal Abdul Nasr, who proved brilliant at playing the US and the USSR off each other to the benefit of Egypt. Nasser's was a largely secular nationalism, and he and his successors saw one of the other antiimperialistic nationalist forces in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, as a threat. So once in power, Nasr and the army banned the Muslim Brotherhood, forcing it underground, where it would disappear and never become an issue again. Wait, what's that? Really? And finally, let's turn to central and southern Africa. One of the most problematic legacies of colonialism was its geography. Colonial boundaries became redefined as the borders of new nation states, even where those boundaries were arbitrary or in some cases, pernicious. The best known example is in Rwanda, where two very different tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsis, were combined into one nation. But more generally, the colonizers focus on value extraction really hurt these new nations. Europeans claimed to bring civilization and economic development to their colonies, but this economic development focused solely on building infrastructure to get resources and export them. Now, whether European powers deliberately sabotage development in Africa is a hot button topic we're going to stay well away from. But this much is inarguably true. When the Europeans left, african nations did not have the institutions necessary to thrive in the postwar industrial world. They had very few schools, for instance, and even fewer universities, like when the Congo achieved independence from Belgium in 1960, there were 16 Congolese college graduates in a nation of 14 million people.","['What was the end of colonization disastrous in Cambodia?', ""What massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia's population between 1975 and 1979?"", 'In Vietnam, the French fought communist led nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh, from almost the moment World War II ended until 1954 when the French were defeated?', 'Who was the army commander who led the coup?']","['One of the most problematic legacies of whatwas its geography ?
