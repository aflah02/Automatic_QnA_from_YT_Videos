Question: What is meant by the phrase "whether these guys deserve their reputations really depends both on what aspects of their reign you look at and how you interpret them"?
Answer: As conquerors, Akbar and Orangzeb had a lot in common. Like Akbar might have sponsored high-minded discussion, but he was also willing to use extreme violence to keep his subjects in line. For example, he slaughtered thousands of inhabitants of the Fort Echitor and ordered his generals to pile up the skulls of Indian princes to frighten them into submission.

Question: What was the reasoning behind Aurangzeb's bad reputation?
Answer: It's possible that Aurangzeb's bad reputation comes from a contemporary preference for tolerance over piety in our rulers, or from a general feeling that states are better ruled by secular than religious laws, or from the fact that it's just hard to rule a declining empire.
Question: How does our experiences and biases affect how we look at the past?
